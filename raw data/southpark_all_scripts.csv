"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Oh, don't they look adorable?","weight-gain-4000",2
"BEBE","Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers...","weight-gain-4000",2
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Oh my God!!","weight-gain-4000",2
"MR. GARRISON","They did it a lot better this morning. They had more energy.","weight-gain-4000",2
"BEBE","The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands...","weight-gain-4000",2

"CHEF","Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know... Kathie-Lee, you are a very special woman...","weight-gain-4000",2
"CHEF","I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler- Moore way... Or special in a extra value meal at Happy Burger way... No no no no-","weight-gain-4000",2
"CHEF","I mean SPECIAL... Like... The song of a hummingbird as it gets ready to... to find that female hummingbird, and -- make sweet love to it -- all night long. Just two hummingbirds moanin' and groanin' and letting their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy...","weight-gain-4000",2

"CARTMAN","Here it is! My big moment of fame!","weight-gain-4000",2
"MR. GARRISON","And then she finished it all by throwing her voice with TWO dummies at once.","weight-gain-4000",2
"WENDY","I know that, Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.","weight-gain-4000",2
"MR. GARRISON","It is too late for me... Young Wendy.","weight-gain-4000",2

"JIMBO","That's right, Stanley, animals are much easier to shoot in the morning!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","Don't worry, Ms. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.","volcano",3
"NED","Hello Mrs. Cartman, how are you today?","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","Dude, that's SICK, mom!","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","(To Uncle Jimbo) Drive! Drive!","volcano",3

"JIMBO","That's the spirit, boys! Let's get that testosterone flowing!!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","Now boys, boys, I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting since this is your first time.","volcano",3
"JIMBO","First of all, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.","volcano",3
"STAN","Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.","volcano",3
"JIMBO","You what?","volcano",3
"NED","Oh yeah, that's right, I don't think 8 year old kids drink beer.","volcano",3
"KYLE","I like chocolate milk!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip. After all, hunting sober is like fishing sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while. Away from civilization.","volcano",3
"JIMBO","Well, here we are!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","Okay, each of you young'ins take a gun, a beer and some smokes.","volcano",3

"JIMBO","My God it's coming right for us!!!","volcano",3
"STAN","Hey! It wasn't coming right for us! It was just sitting there!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","SHHH! Not so loud!! Now that there's just a technicality.","volcano",3
"KYLE","What d'ya mean?","volcano",3
"JIMBO","You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","Democrats piss me off!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot something, we have to say; ""It's coming right for us!""","volcano",3
"STAN","Wow, you're smart, Uncle Jimbo!","volcano",3
"NED","(pointing) Jimbo LOOK!","volcano",3

"KYLE","I guess so.","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","Oh, dude... I'm starting to have flashbacks!","volcano",3
"KYLE","What?","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","Danforth! Pull up flank, look out for Charlies up in the trees!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","This one's yours, Stan!","volcano",3
"JIMBO","'It's comin' right for us'!","volcano",3
"NED","""It's coming right for us""!","volcano",3
"KYLE","Shoot it, Stan!","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","I got your back, soldier!","volcano",3
"STAN","I can't...","volcano",3
"JIMBO","What the-- What's wrong with you?!","volcano",3
"STAN","I don't wanna shoot the bunny.","volcano",3
"JIMBO","(shocked) What the hell are you talking about, you don't want to shoot the bunny? You're babbling, you're not making any sense! You're hysterical!","volcano",3
"STAN","I'm not hysterical. I just don't want to shoot the bunny.","volcano",3
"JIMBO","No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree hugger!","volcano",3
"CARTMAN","Yeah, hippie! Go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything!","volcano",3

"STAN","NO!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","(laughing) Yup, your sister kicked your ass.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","She's just pissed off 'cause she got head gear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Yeah, but that sucks you get your butt kicked by a girl Stan.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","I would NEVER let a woman kick my ass! If she tried anything, I'd be like 'HEY! You get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie!!'","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet. But I know that she's an evil bitch.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"KYLE","You mean this one?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Yeah.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","He's my new pet elephant.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Whoa, dude, where'd you get a pet elephant?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","I got it mail order from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Wow, that's cool!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big. And that its poop is bigger than our couch.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","That's why MY mom got ME a pot bellied pig. 'Cause it's poop is small.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"MS. CRABTREE","Oh, I'm sorry, little girl... (Pause) But you still can't get on. You have to take the special Ed bus.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"CARTMAN","Yes, ma'am.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","And now, children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about Genetic Engineering.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. HAT","That's right, Mr. Garrison, Genetic Engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals and make them better.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Mr. Garrison?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Yes, Kyle.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","With genetic engineering, can you make a elephant smaller?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Well uh... Yes I suppose you could.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","That's it! I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make... POT BELLIED ELEPHANTS!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","They'd be smart like elephants but small like pigs!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","That'd be cool!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"BEBE","I wanna pot-bellied elephant!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"PIP","Yes, I'll pay $50 for one.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"TERRANCE","That's stupid!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Shut up Terrance, we can genetical engineer anything we want.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"TERRANCE","Oh yea! I bet I can genetically clone a WHOLE HUMAN BEING before you crossbreed an elephant and a pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","I bet you can't!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"TERRANCE","Watch me plebeian!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. HAT","Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering let's us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes... like German people. You know you boys might want to visit the genetic engineering ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Genetic engineering ranch?! Sweet!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Wait, wait, we still need a pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","We can use Cartman's pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Hey!! You leave Fluffy out of this!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","We're not gonna hurt her. We just need some of her blood.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","You're not using any of Fluffy's blood! Else I'll kick you in the nuts.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Kyle... Kyle! No!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Uh, uh Stanley, Can I talk to you for a minute?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Okay...","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","(hanging his head) Yes.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, dear... Here, Stanly, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. HAT","I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me ANYTHING. Now, who hits you? Is it your father or your mother?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Oh, neither, it's my sister.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. GARRISON","Your sister? Oh, for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss! Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo foo problems... and give me back my cocoa!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"SHELLEY","Hey!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Hi Shelley.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"SHELLEY","Are you looking at my head gear?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Head gear? What head gear?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"SHELLEY","Are you looking at my head gear?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Oh, gosh. I didn't really notice.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"SHELLEY","You little liar!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","No! I think it looks terrific! It matches your --","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Ready to go Stan?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Go where?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","To the genetical engineering ranch! We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","NOBODY'S SPLICING NOTHING FROM FLUFFY!!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"SHELLEY","I swear I'm going to kill you Stan!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Why is your sister so mean to you, dude?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass I'd be all like, 'HEY, LISTEN MISSY!!! WHY DON'T YOU GO KNIT ME A SWEATER BEFORE I SLAP YOU IN THE FACE!!!!'","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","This must be it.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","No Cartman! We're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","It's just a stupid pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Yeah, quit being such a baby.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Baby? Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Least I'm not a little pig-#$%@er!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","AY!! I'm taking my pig and screw you guys, I'm going home. This whole idea is stupid anyway!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","What the hell would you know, you fat sweaty mongoloid!? You never get higher than a D!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","AY!! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","There's no Jews in San Francisco you retard!!! --","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","I'll kick you in the nuts!!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Can I help you?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Uh... Yeah... We want to cross breed an elephant with a pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Brilliant idea! Huge, elephant-sized pigs!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","No no no, we want to make little potbellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Oh, that's an even better idea! Come on in!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering...","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","It's okay fluffy... Nobody's going to hurt you...","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","It's thanks to the wonder of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I've created things that will change the world for the better -- (pointing) -- For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","(To Stan) How does that make the world better?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","And here, of course, is my four-assed ostrich, and my four-assed mongoose.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Oh, well, I suppose so... Ah yes, over here --","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Here I have rats spliced with ducks... And gorillas spliced with mosquitos. And here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunny fish!!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Hey... These bunny ears are tied on with little strings!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","And over here is swiss cheese spliced with chalk... And a beard.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Well what about our pot-bellied elephant?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Oh... well I'm sorry children, but pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by Loverboy?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Which song is that?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","""Da'n Do-A, Pig and Elephant D-N-A Just Won't Splice?"".","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","However maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","You know it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"STAN","-- Ow!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Hmm? What? Oh excuse me.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"MR. MEPHESTO","Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","Watch out Stan, genetic engineers are crazy!!!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CARTMAN","Come on Fluffy!!!","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"CHEF","How're you doing?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"CHEF","Why bad?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5
"KYLE","We need to genetically engineer a pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"STAN","I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"STAN","Hey, uh you guys wanna come over to my house?","an-elephant-makes-love-to-a-pig",5

"CHEF","Let me show you boys what I'm talking about. (singing) Tonight is right for love, you know. I wanna touch you where the lights don't go -- Tonight is right for love, love gravy.

"KYLE","SOMEBODY bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still has money on you.","damien",8

"CARTMAN","Yeah, but I get to wear it first. I said!!","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","Children, children, to honor this special time of year, we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","Yes, Eric?","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","...No, that's a Caesarian section, Eric... But that's okay. Remember there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","(Pointing) You mean like Kenny?","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","Exactly.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","(Raising his hand) Mr. Garrison, why do poor people always smell like sour milk?","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","I don't know, Eric, they just do.","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","Now children, I want each of you to bring in ONE CAN of food, and later the Mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","I'm not bringing in food for poor people. Screw them!","starvin-marvin",9
"WENDY","Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Hey you guys, do you hear something? I think I hear the flower children calling.","starvin-marvin",9
"WENDY","This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that I pay for?!","starvin-marvin",9
"WENDY","Many would rather die than go to those places!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Well then perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson. Right Mr. Hat?","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. HAT","That's right Mr. Garrison, Englbert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was second?","starvin-marvin",9
"CLYDE","AGHAGAGAH!!!!!","starvin-marvin",9
"MR. GARRISON","What the hell is going on?!","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Well... You don't see that everyday.","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","Okay, now once we have all the canned foods collected... We'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor...","starvin-marvin",9
"ASSISTANT","It should be something festive!","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","Mayor! We've got a very big problem!!","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","Ah... You're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?","starvin-marvin",9
"MAPHESTO","Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake! I was trying to genetically engineer Turkeys for Thanksgiving...","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","(Skeptical) Uh-huhhhh....","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","You know, to provide food for the needy.","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","(Still skeptical) Of course.","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","Well, something went wrong, and the turkeys broke free, and the worst part is... They're REALLY pissed off!","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","(Still Skeptical) Nnnaturally...","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","Oh do go on.","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","We have to stop them or they could destroy everything! Time is short!!","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","You were saying?","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","Oh, my...","starvin-marvin",9
"MEPHESTO","Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.","starvin-marvin",9
"MAYOR","Now why would you say that?","starvin-marvin",9
"BOYS","(Ad libbing) DID IT COME?! DID IT COME?! IS IT HERE YET?! I GET TO USE IT FIRST YOU GUYS!!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Mom... Did our Digital Sports Watch come yet?","starvin-marvin",9

"KYLE","THE DIGITAL SPORTS WATCH IS HERE!!!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","What the hell?!","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Hey... It looks like one of those Etheropians.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","Oh, man! They must have accidentally sent him instead of the Sports watch!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Whoa! That was cool!","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","Yeah, how'd he make those clicking sounds?","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","What's your name, dude?","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","I think he said his name is 'Marvin'.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","(Laughing) Yeah. STARVIN' Marvin!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Nice to meet you, Starvin' Marvin!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Hey Mom!","starvin-marvin",9

"STAN","Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Come on, Starvin' Marvin! I want you to meet my little brother.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","No, No! He's my son, I adopted him.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","It was MY mom's credit card!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Okay, okay we'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week. Then at Stan's, then with me.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Yeah, and never with Kenny 'cause his family is too poor.","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Totally!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","OW!","starvin-marvin",9
"WOMAN","Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful...","starvin-marvin",9
"MAN","Not as beautiful as you.","starvin-marvin",9
"WOMAN","Oh!","starvin-marvin",9
"MAN","Oh, Darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.","starvin-marvin",9
"WOMAN","Ooh, They're so beautiful...","starvin-marvin",9
"MAN","Not as beautiful as you.","starvin-marvin",9
"WOMAN","Look at the way they foam at the mouth. Like beautiful suds of beer.","starvin-marvin",9
"MAN","Not as beautiful as --","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","This is a great way for you to experience America, Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'All you can eat buffet'.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Yeah, here you can eat all you want for only $6.99 That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights. Except for Kenny's family, 'cause to them $6.99 is two year's income.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Why is YOUR family poor, Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","You see, Starvin Marvin, these are what we call APPETIZERS.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","This is what you eat before you eat... to make you more hungry.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Oop! Food's here! That's it for the appetizers!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","No Starvin' Marvin that's my pot pie!","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","Cartman you butt pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah you're right. (to Marvin) Are you going to eat all of your peach cobbler? No you don't want all that. Why don't you share it with me... Let me just have some of that.","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Children, children, I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive...","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","And can't we do a little better than -- (Reading the cans) Creamed corn, creamed corn and creamed corn?","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Please bring in more diverse food children, or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty 'corny' Thanksgiving.","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Corny... Corny... Gravy... Corny Thanksgiving... Hoo!","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Anyway, children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show and tell...","starvin-marvin",9
"BOYS","(ad lib) Yeah, yeah... We did. We do! We do!","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","All right, boys, show us what you've brought.","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em, Starvin' Marvin.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","No! Starvin' Marvin, that's KENNY's creamed corn!","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","No Starvin' Marvin... That's a BAD starvin' Marvin!","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Boys, what the hell are you doing? This is horribly, horribly WRONG!! How did you get this child?","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","The sports watch from the commercial?","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Yeah, that one.","starvin-marvin",9
"BEBE","I want a Starvin' Marvin!","starvin-marvin",9
"CLYDE","Me too!","starvin-marvin",9
"PIP","Yes I'll pay fifty dollars for one!","starvin-marvin",9
"GARRISON","Boys, you're too young to take care of a child. I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","(To Stan) Aw! I TOLD you we shouldn't have brought him to school, dude!!","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Now, boys I hope you've learned your lesson.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","No.","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","You can't care for this child!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's lives. You're supposed to just send money. And once in a while they write you a letter.","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","So why can't he live here now?","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Because he can't!","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Because why?","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Because 8 year olds can't be parents.","starvin-marvin",9
"KYLE","Then you take care of him.","starvin-marvin",9
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","I can't. I'm, ah, very busy. I send my $5 a month. See?","starvin-marvin",9
"STAN","This sucks. Starvin' Marvin is our friend.","starvin-marvin",9
"CARTMAN","Oh well, back to the poor country with you.","starvin-marvin",9

"LEONARD MALTIN","Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbara Streisand exhibits?","mecha-streisand",12
"CHEF","Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-","mecha-streisand",12
"LEONARD MALTIN","MORE THAN A BITCH, Mr. Chef!! She is a calculating, self-centered egotistical... bitch. She was born in a small town, her mother was a Jackel and her father was an insurance salesman!","mecha-streisand",12
"CHEF","(He gets a chill) Woo... Insurance salesman?","mecha-streisand",12
"LEONARD MALTIN","(Rapidly) When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer. But by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond. The diamond of Pantheous.","mecha-streisand",12
"CHEF","Okay, you know what? Never mind. I don't need to know all this -- forget I asked.","mecha-streisand",12
"LEONARD MALTIN","(Very quickly) Before she was seven, the keepers of Pantheous learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbara Streisand found one of the triangles...","mecha-streisand",12
"CHEF","And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?","mecha-streisand",12
"LEONARD MALTIN","Yes... Mr. Chef, if Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind...","mecha-streisand",12
"LEONARD MALTIN","MECHA-STREISAND.","mecha-streisand",12
"CHEF","Mecha-Streisand? Oh man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good!","mecha-streisand",12
"STAN","Man, the bus sure is late.","mecha-streisand",12
"CARTMAN","Hmmm, I wonder what I should do with MY triangle, now that it is MY triangle...","mecha-streisand",12
"KYLE","Dammit, Cartman! I gave it to you so you would SHUT UP!!","mecha-streisand",12
"DISGUISED BABS","Oh, hello there little boys. How are you today?","mecha-streisand",12

"KYLE","YOUR triangle?","mecha-streisand",12
"DISGUISED BABS","Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my Kidney Dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it, I was sure to die within hours.","mecha-streisand",12
"CARTMAN","Oh no you don't! Finders keepers!","mecha-streisand",12
"DISGUISED BABS","But I'll die!","mecha-streisand",12
"CARTMAN","Well I guess we'll have to Roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can.","mecha-streisand",12
"DISGUISED BABS","I want to give you a BIG cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.","mecha-streisand",12
"CARTMAN","It is?!","mecha-streisand",12
"STAN","Hey, no wonder that Barbara Streisand lady wanted it!","mecha-streisand",12
"DISGUISED BABS","Oh, ha, ha... Who is that?","mecha-streisand",12
"KYLE","Oh, just this really, really old lady who wishes she was still only forty-five.","mecha-streisand",12
"STAN","Yeah! And you should have seen her nose, it was big enough to land Stealth Bombers on!","mecha-streisand",12

"CARTMAN","Sweet! I'm gonna be rich!! Bet you wish you wouldn't have given me back that triangle NOW, huh, Kyle! DUMBASS!","mecha-streisand",12

"DOCTOR","Meanwhile, team A will go to the holding area... HERE. Where there is a television and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"DOCTOR","By that time, team B (remember, that's you Kenny) should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors HERE.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"HERE."," HERE.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"DOCTOR","Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view through THIS window, of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then you can proceed down into the generator and power it on. Are there any questions?","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"CARTMAN","No, that sounds pretty sweet to me.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15

"MEPHESTO","Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15

"MEPHESTO","No, no, not exactly, but she did have a penis.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"MEPHESTO","The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Ms. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that SHE is his father. And she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance.","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15
"CARTMAN","Oh man this is fuckin' weak!!","cartman's-mom-is-still-a-dirty-slut",15

"JIMBO","Well, it appears that now a lot of you uh ""skeptics"" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer.  Roll it.  There you go.

By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'","city-on-the-edge-of-forever",20
"MS. CRABTREE","KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!","city-on-the-edge-of-forever",20

"CARTMAN","No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens,  except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

"MAYOR","Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"ROBERT","Uh-huh.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"MAYOR","Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

"CARTMAN","Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

"STAN","Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"CARTMAN","I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"STAN","If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"CHEF","It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!  I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

"MR. HANKEY","Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebritites are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art.""","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"ROBERT","I have had enough of you!","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22

"STAN","Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.","chef's-chocolate-salty-balls",22
"SHARON","No, uh-no, she's been perfectly healthy.","chicken-pox",23
"DR. DOCTOR","Well, that's the problem. You see, chicken pox is a pretty normal thing for young children. But as you get older it becomes more and more a- ferocious disease.","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","Shelley, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.","chicken-pox",23
"SHELLEY","Oh, whoo-peee!","chicken-pox",23
"DR. DOCTOR","You know, most people don't realize that chicken pox is actually a form of herpes.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Dude, you've got herpes on your face!","chicken-pox",23
"SHELLEY","Shut up, brat!","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","Will my daughter be okay?","chicken-pox",23
"DR. DOCTOR","She'll be fine.","chicken-pox",23
"SHELLEY","Stop it!","chicken-pox",23
"DR. DOCTOR","We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","OOOWWW!","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","ü¾“ ¼and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.","chicken-pox",23
"LIANE","I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chicken pox. Let them get it now, while they're young.","chicken-pox",23
"LIANE","Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chicken pox, just so I would get it.","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","So it's not such a crazy idea after all?","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Are you guys having a meeting or something?","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.","chicken-pox",23
"SHARON","Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final!","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Oh weak!","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Yeah, it's pretty weird.","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo!  Well, here's Kenny's house.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","In the ghetto","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","Yeah?","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with-?","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","That's the whole point, remember?? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","Oh yeah.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Catch what?","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","And his momma cried","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Sshh! Cartman!","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","What?","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!","chicken-pox",23

"KYLE","Heheheh, bun.","chicken-pox",23
"KENNY","(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Where is the- Nintendo?","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Oh, good. I'm starving.","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Let's say grace.","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. Andn since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.","chicken-pox",23
"ALL","Amen.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Pfff","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Okay, let's dig in.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?","chicken-pox",23
"MR. MCCORMICK","So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat, lawyer paychecks?","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","I don't know.","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Stuart, don't even get started!","chicken-pox",23
"STUART","What? I'm just askin' a question. You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Puh. I heard that!","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","That aint why, Stuart!  It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!","chicken-pox",23
"STUART","Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!","chicken-pox",23
"STUART","You just don't know how to used spices and stuff.","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Oh, Jesus. Are you fucking kidding me?","chicken-pox",23
"STUART","Ey! We don't say 'fuck' at the table, you little asshole!","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.","chicken-pox",23
"KENNY","(Aa-choo!)","chicken-pox",23
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Huh?","chicken-pox",23
"KENNY","(Waa-choo!)","chicken-pox",23
"CARTMAN","Ey!","chicken-pox",23

"CARTMAN","Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.","chicken-pox",23
"KENNY","(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)","chicken-pox",23
"STAN","Oh.","chicken-pox",23

"KYLE","Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?","chicken-pox",23
"KYLE","Gods and clods?","chicken-pox",23

"STAN","Aw, that hunk of fat-  Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?","clubhouses",25
"SHARON","Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","What?! Why?","clubhouses",25
"SHARON","Because, we're divorced, Stanley.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?","clubhouses",25
"SHARON","Yeah, kind of.","clubhouses",25

"SHARON","I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.","clubhouses",25
"ROY","Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","This is happening way too fast.","clubhouses",25
"ROY","Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!","clubhouses",25
"BLONDE","So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!""","clubhouses",25
"CARTMAN","Ahaw, that's weak.","clubhouses",25
"BLONDE","And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!""","clubhouses",25

"BLONDE","So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!""","clubhouses",25
"CARTMAN","Sweet.","clubhouses",25
"BLONDE","And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.","clubhouses",25
"CARTMAN","Killer weak sweet!","clubhouses",25
"BLONDE","I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.  I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!","clubhouses",25
"CARTMAN","I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gona fingerpaint!""","clubhouses",25
"STAN","Okay. We're done.","clubhouses",25
"KYLE","Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.","clubhouses",25

"STAN","But I don't understand why we have to-","clubhouses",25
"RANDY","Well, hello, ladies.","clubhouses",25
"PASSENGER","Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.","clubhouses",25
"RANDY","I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?","clubhouses",25
"RANDY","Well, no, because you're a family! You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.","clubhouses",25
"RANDY","Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","What? That's it?","clubhouses",25
"RANDY","Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out. You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?","clubhouses",25
"STAN","I gguess, but-","clubhouses",25
"STAN","Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.","clubhouses",25

"STAN","No way, dude! Don't be silly.","clubhouses",25
"BEBE","Come on, Wendy.","clubhouses",25
"STAN","We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?","clubhouses",25
"KYLE","Right. Why?","clubhouses",25
"STAN","Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.","clubhouses",25
"KYLE","Too eager to what?","clubhouses",25
"STAN","To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez.","clubhouses",25
"WENDY","Hi, guys.","clubhouses",25

Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk.

"OFFICER BARBRADY","Why?","cow-days",26
"KYLE","This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!","cow-days",26
"OFFICER BARBRADY","If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.  What do you have to say, carnival operator?","cow-days",26

"STAN","This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.","cow-days",26
"KYLE","Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!","cow-days",26
"CARTMAN","What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?","cow-days",26

"CARTMAN","Hey, this is sweet.","cow-days",26
"KYLE","You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?","cow-days",26
"CARTMAN","I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.","cow-days",26
"STAN","We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.","cow-days",26
"CARTMAN","Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!","cow-days",26
"STAN","How long was that?","cow-days",26

"CARTMAN","Yeah, this is sweet!","cow-days",26
"STAN","What are you going to do?","cow-days",26
"KYLE","Get the bull in the balls with a smowball.","cow-days",26
"STAN","Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea.","cow-days",26
"CARTMAN","Eeyy!","cow-days",26

"PROSECUTOR","I am, your honor. Johnny Cochran.","chef-aid",27
"SOME OBSERVERS","Ooo.","chef-aid",27
"CHEF","Why 'Oh oh'?","chef-aid",27
"CHEF","Oh oh.","chef-aid",27
"MR. GARRISON","I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!","chef-aid",27

"REPORTER","And so, on this fifteenth day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the ü¾“ ¼day, Johnny Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous ""Chewbacca"" defense?","chef-aid",27
"CARTMAN","What's a Chewbacca defense?","chef-aid",27
"KYLE","I don't know.","chef-aid",27
"STAN","That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.","chef-aid",27
"CARTMAN","God-damned, I hate that Cochran guy. If he was here in front of me, I'd be like, ""Ay! You stupid son of a bitch, you d-. I b-. I'ma I'm gonna kick you in the nuts!""","chef-aid",27
"KYLE","I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.","chef-aid",27
"JUDGE MOSES","Mr. Johnny Cochran, your closing arguments.","chef-aid",27
"COCHRAN","Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago. And they make a good case. Hell, I almost felt pity myself. But ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, I have one, final, thing I want you to consider.  Ladies and gentleman, this is Chew-bacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk, but Chewbaccaü¾“ ¼ LIVES ü¾“ ¼on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does NOT MAKE SENSE.","chef-aid",27
"CHEF","What?","chef-aid",27
"COCHRAN","Why would a Wookie, an eight-foot tall Wookie, want to live on Endor, with a bunch of two-foot tall Ewoks? That does NOT MAKE SENSE!  But more important, you have to ask yourself: What does this have to do with this case? Nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does NOT MAKE SENSE! Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca! Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberatin' and conjugatin' the Emancipation Proclamation,  does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does NOT MAKE SENSE! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.","chef-aid",27
"JUDGE MOSES","Oh-kay then.","chef-aid",27
"CARTMAN","Wow, he's good.","chef-aid",27
"REPORTER","In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnny Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as was anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense  Whether or not it worked, is up to the jury to decide.","chef-aid",27
"JUDGE MOSES","How find you, the jury?","chef-aid",27
"JURY FOREMAN","We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy, guilty as charged.","chef-aid",27

"ELTON","That's a great idea!","chef-aid",27
"CHEF","And Elton. Why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know. Some slick trousers and shit.","chef-aid",27
"ELTON","And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never've had a career in music.","chef-aid",27

"STAN","I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.","spooky-fish",28

"CARTMAN","Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to.","spooky-fish",28
"STUART","Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?","spooky-fish",28

"CARTMAN","Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!","spooky-fish",28
"KENNY","(It's the only thing I could afford.)","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.","spooky-fish",28

"CARTMAN","God, I hate you, Kenny.  I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","God, will you shut up?!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Yeah.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Do you think animals can be murderers, too?","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","You seem tired, Stan.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","I haven't been sleeping well.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Why?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Hoh, that sucks, dude.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Cartman?","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","What are you doing?!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","What do you mean, what am I doing?! I''m just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","You can't be standing there, Cartman.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Why the hell not?!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Because you're standing over there!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Aaah! Son of a bitch!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Wow, you don't see this every day.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","I can't believe what I'm seeing.","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","It's like I'm looking in a mirror.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Dude, this is hella weird.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Oh. Uh-Officer Babrady, Woowhat what a surprise. Wwhat can I do for you?","spooky-fish",28
"OFFICER BABRADY","Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Is that so?","spooky-fish",28
"OFFICER BABRADY","Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.","spooky-fish",28
"OFFICER BABRADY","No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Why would you wanna do that?","spooky-fish",28
"OFFICER BABRADY","Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I?  Well, this all looks in-  oh? Tennis anyone?","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!","spooky-fish",28
"BARBRADY","Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few qustions.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Hello there, children!","spooky-fish",28
"THE BOYS","Hey, Chef.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Uh, Chef?","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Or haaauuunted hash browns.","spooky-fish",28

"CHEF","And a teeeeerrifying napkin!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Chef!","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","What?!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","We have problems!","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Well, what's the first problem?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem?  Oh, nohoho.  Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","ü¾“ ¼and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Exactly what do you remember?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Of course! That's it!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","What?","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Will you stop saying that word?!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.","spooky-fish",28
"CHEF","How do you mean?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.","spooky-fish",28
"AUNT FLO","Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys: you don't even have to put a quarter in her.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Cartman!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Dude, this is hella cool.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?","spooky-fish",28
"AUNT FLO","Nn-oh.  I got it from the pet store, Stanley.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Do you remember what pet store?","spooky-fish",28
"AUNT FLO","Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Where?","spooky-fish",28
"AUNT FLO","I know I have the address written down somewhere.  Let me look.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","I'll help you, Stan.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Just help me take it back. Come on! Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","It was the fish!","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Now we'll never know where that pet store is!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Can do!","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Screw you!","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! I've got such a good boy, such a handsom boy!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Come on, we're running out of time.","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","Hey, why is the basement door locked?","spooky-fish",28
"BARBRADY","-crack corn and I don't care","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground.""","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!","spooky-fish",28
"ANNOUNCER","And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special.","spooky-fish",28
"TERRANCE","(Fart)","spooky-fish",28
"PHILLIP","That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","What's so funny about that?","spooky-fish",28
"KITTY","Meow.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!","spooky-fish",28
"KITTY","Meow.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah.","spooky-fish",28
"CARTMAN","NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Yeah, my goldfish-.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","I know.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","You guys, I found the pet store!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Come on, let's go!  Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","I believe you, sweetheart.  Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Can I help you boys?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","I wanna return a fish.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Damn it!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","What?","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it?  Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Yeah, dude.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Damn it!  Just like all the other returns!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Why?","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Why? I don't know. I was drunk.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Well, that certainly would explain a lot.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Like what?","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Well, like this.  I've been wondering what the hell this was.","spooky-fish",28
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you.  Okay, bye, then.","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","Sharon?","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Yyes, hon?","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away.","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","What is it?","spooky-fish",28
"SHARON","I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.","spooky-fish",28
"RANDY","Oh. Wuwell, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","I can't give you your money back.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","No! I won't take it back!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly , you're gonna take this fish back.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","All right, you win.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","And sir, can I make a suggestion? Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","You kick ass, evil Cartman!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Yeah!","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him!","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer.","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","What the-?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL STAN","He was here! Cartman was just here!","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","Who are you?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL KYLE","We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","I don't know who you mean?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL KYLE","Maybe this will jog your memory!","spooky-fish",28
"CLERK","No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.","spooky-fish",28

"STAN","You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe.","spooky-fish",28
"KYLE","Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?","spooky-fish",28
"EVIL CARTMAN","Let's use Kenny's squash.","spooky-fish",28
"STAN","Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.","spooky-fish",28

"HOWARD","What?!","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29
"MANSON","You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29
"STAN","But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29

"ROBERT POONER","And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, every one.","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29
"MANSON","And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season. What do you think, guys?","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29
"INMATE","It sucks, just like all your other books.","merry-christmas,-charlie-manson!",29

"TWEEK","AAAghah heheh.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Oh, not Tweek.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Dude, we can't work with this kid.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Yuh-ugh!","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see?","gnomes",30
"STAN","No.","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow! And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!","gnomes",30

"MR. TWEEK","Hello there, customer.","gnomes",30
"CUSTOMER","Hello. How are you today?","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee?","gnomes",30
"CUSTOMER","I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postem from the Harbucks Coffee Corporationü¾“ ¼","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","That's right. How come yuu don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Oh, forget it, my my store is not for sale.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer.  This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Well all right.  How about $500,000?","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","The answer is still no, Mr. Postem. You see, when my father opened this store 30 yars ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more.  And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","But that could put me out of business.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!","gnomes",30
"BARBRADY","Hello, Mr. Tweek.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Hi, Officer Barbrady.","gnomes",30

"BARBRADY","Ths usual.  Ogh. Thanks. See you tomorrow.","gnomes",30

"TWEEK","AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Great. A lot of help you are, kid.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","The gnomes!","gnomes",30
"STAN","What?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","We can do our report on the gnomes.","gnomes",30
"STAN","What gnomes?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Yeah, I've neve seen any underpants gnomes.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Some things are more important than money.  The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Oh, hello, son. How was your day?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","UUuuUunh!","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","That's good. Who are your little friends?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","What do you mean?!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","We're his oral report buddies.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.","gnomes",30
"STAN","'K. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Richard!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Mwaaah! Slavery?","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Yes, slavery.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Wow, that sucks, dude.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","They really have my balls in a salad shooter.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Yeah.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Uunnnnhh!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Come on, you guys! We better get to work!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Man, this stuff is strong.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Kind of bitter.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","What if my parents go out of business? Uhwhat'll I do?","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Don't worry about it.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","But we'll starve and die like dogs.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?","gnomes",30
"KENNY","(Fuck you!)","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Heheh, you suck, Kenny.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Aaaaaa!","gnomes",30
"KENNY","(Let me try! Let me try!)","gnomes",30
"STAN","Yeess, this stuff rocks!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Honest, dudes! I feel awesome!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Whoopee!","gnomes",30
"KENNY","(Look at me! Look at me!)","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Eyah! Eyah! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! You guys! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","I just have ground.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Killer!!","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Ey, let me have some grounds.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Hogh, my stomach hurts.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek!","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","How's the report going, boys?","gnomes",30
"STAN","Bad!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Oh, do you need some more coffee?","gnomes",30
"THE BOYS","Eugh.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","No... more... coffee. Blech.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Well. Boys, ub. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.","gnomes",30
"ALL","You did?!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it...","gnomes",30
"STAN","No, we'll use it.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","All right.  And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Sure.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Now, when you give the report,  just make sure that you read this part first, okay?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","There they are!","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Aaaaa! They took them again!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Thanks, dude.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","My pleasure. G'night, boys.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America,","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","What will become of the endeavoring American family?","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Uurrgh!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","And that's our report, I guess.","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even-!","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Great job!","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","Yes, great job.","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Neither did we.","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something.","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! Lead the way, boys!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Huh??","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Uunh, it's too much pressure!","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey.","gnomes",30

"TWEEK","I need coffee.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","I know how you boys feel.  Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt- .","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","Dad!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","What?","gnomes",30
"TWEEK","The metaphors, man!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Oh, sorry. Here you go.","gnomes",30

"MRS. TWEEK","Liike, how do you mean?","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.","gnomes",30

"MAYOR","You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","That's right.","gnomes",30
"MAYOR","Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Yes!","gnomes",30

"BLOND MEMBER","Hooray!","gnomes",30
"THE OTHER MEMBERS","Hooray!","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!","gnomes",30
"STAN","Uh. Hooray.","gnomes",30
"MAYOR","So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up,","gnomes",30

"JOHNSON","Is it cold in here?","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's REALLY horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.","gnomes",30

"TWEEK","Aaaarh!","gnomes",30
"VOICEOVER","It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... Do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else.","gnomes",30

"MR. TWEEK","Wow, it it's great!","gnomes",30

"MRS. TWEEK","I have a big problem with this!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","What do you mean?","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","But, kids are great to get people on our side.","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore.","gnomes",30

"POSTEM","Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious. And it makes you feel super!  I have a surprise for you: the new kiddicino from Harbucks. More sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Uh, Mr. Postem, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Uh I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","What?!","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee.  Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day.","gnomes",30
"MAYOR","Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths ...here.  All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uuuuhh, like...","gnomes",30

"MR. GARRISON","Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","What now?","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Oh, God, when is this gonna end?","gnomes",30

"TWEEK","Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","So what are we gonna say?","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?","gnomes",30
"STAN","'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Does anybody know anything about corporations?","gnomes",30

"CARTMAN","I think my mom is a corporation.","gnomes",30

"KYLE","Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","No it isn't, you guys!","gnomes",30
"GNOME","This is where all our work is done.","gnomes",30
"CARTMAN","So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?","gnomes",30
"GNOME","Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Sooo, what's phase 2?","gnomes",30
"GNOME","Hey, what's phase 2?","gnomes",30
"GNOME","Yeah yeah yeah, but. What about phase 2?","gnomes",30

"GNOME","You know.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Underpants?","gnomes",30
"GNOMES","Underpants!","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","Toto, ladies and gentlemen!","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.","gnomes",30
"SUPPORTER","Underpants gnomes?","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Big corporations are good!","gnomes",30
"SUPPORTER","What?","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.","gnomes",30
"STAN","Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!","gnomes",30
"TOWNSMAN",":	Ogh.","gnomes",30
"LADY MEMBER","That's not what you said last time!","gnomes",30
"KYLE","Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.","gnomes",30
"MR. GARRISON","You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!","gnomes",30
"MRS. TWEEK","These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?","gnomes",30
"TOWNSMAN","Hey, this is pretty damn good.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","Hey. Hey, that is good.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","It's a French roast.","gnomes",30
"MR. TWEEK","It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.","gnomes",30
"POSTEM","Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lo-o-ot of money.","gnomes",30
"KENNY","(Oh, no!)","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"AUSSIE","I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"STAN","Holy crap. dude!","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"KYLE","Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"STAN","Yeah!","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"CARTMAN","I think we're almost there, you guys.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee.""","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"TARDY MAN","Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee!","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"CARTMAN","Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Reward? What reward?","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link  in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"MEPHESTO","Steve it is.","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"MEPHESTO","Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Autralopithecus from the Paleolithic era.  Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer sinceü¾“ ¼ 1996!  This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"BARBRADY","Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"REPORTER","What about the prehistoric ice man?","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"BARBRADY","Oh, yeah. There is that.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"REPORTER","Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do.  But it is my opinion tha this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months!  Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"REPORTER","Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"KYLE","Well, I fell down this ice cavern, and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope-","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"REPORTER","The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurrasic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Ugh? What's this?","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Holy crap! He's alive??","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","That's impossible!  Do an EKG on him!","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Well, quick, do something!","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Nono, we've got to think this through. Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MAYOR","Well, you just can't let him die.","prehistoric-ice-man",31
"MEPHESTO","Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"KENY","(Blue.)","prehistoric-ice-man",31

"MR. GARRISON","Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison.  How are we all doing today?!  I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MR. GARRISON","Eric Cartman, you say ""excuse me""!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Okay.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MR. GARRISON","Go ahead.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Children, we are a national choir called, ""Getting Gay With Kids!"" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(This sounds fucking screwed)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MR. GARRISON","Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR BOY","Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bolldozed every year?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR GIRL","That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen  is made in the rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","So, who wants to join the fun??","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","What if you don't have any rhythm?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Excuse me?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Shut up, fatass!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Choirs suck.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MR. GARRISON","Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! Go ahead.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Well, uh, that's all, really.  So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MR. GARRISON","All right, that does it!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CRAIG","I know.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Why can't you behave?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CRAIG","...I don't know.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","What do you have to say for yourself?! Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh-  Did you just flip me off?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CRAIG","No.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, mkay, and get your head straight, uh-  There! You just flipped me off again!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CRAIG","No I didn't.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, mkay?! Next!  Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Hey, Craig.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"ERIC","Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? ""The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-""","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, mkay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","What?!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","You can't do that!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.')","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I think this will be very good for you","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","But we don't even care about the rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","And that's exactly why you need to go!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR BOY","Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"SHARON","Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Nooo-ho!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Whoopee.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Yeah, pretty much.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.","rainforest-schmainforest",32

"KENNY","(Kenny!)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Oh.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR GIRL","Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","The nightmare begins.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San Josü¾Ž–”¼, which is the capital of Costa Rica.  Oh! This is so exciting!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, sit down!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny?  Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Argh! That's just so untrue.)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Your family isn't poor?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Whoa, dude, look over there!  Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MIDDLE PROSTITUTE","Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Okay.  Kugheek!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, SIT DOWN!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Oh my God,  it smells like ass out here.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","All right, that does it!  Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Uh-huh.)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Why?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Eh-heheh!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"EL PRESIDENTE","ü¾™¦ˆ¼Quü¾Ž–”¼?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"EL PRESIDENTE","ü¾™¦ˆ¼Quü¾Ž–”¼?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","We're the group singing for the ""Save The Rainforest"" summit tomorrow?  Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now.  Children, do any of you speak Spanish?  Don't you dare!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Sorry I'm late.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Oh, no problem.  Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"EL PRESIDENTE","ü¾Œ–„¼O! ü¾Œ–„¼O! Save The Rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32

"EL PRESIDENTE","ü¾™¦ˆ¼Quü¾Ž–”¼?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Yeah, I think so)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"THE TAPE","Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Thanks!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Fuck off, Cartman!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","No! That's a stereotype.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","God-damn, it's hot out here!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Aaah! Snake!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","No, dude. That's a branch.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Oh.  Aaah! Snake!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","No. That's the same branch again.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Oh.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Bad! Bad monkey!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, what the heck are you doing??","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","And here is a three-toed sloth.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Respect my authoritah!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KIDS","YEAH!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR BOY","I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","What's the Yanogapa?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","AAAAAAA!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Stanley, what is it?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","SNAAAKE!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","Oh, yes. Uhthis is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","AAAAAAA!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","What's the matter, little boy?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","He's a little wuss, what's it look like?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","I'm just a-scared of snakes.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"PABLO","Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh my God!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Jesus Christ, is he dead?!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Dude!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","My guess would be 'yes.'","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh, no! God, no, no!  Don't panic, children","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Bad! That's a bad snay-ah!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Maybe we came from that way.  No, nno. Let's try this way.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Look. Everything is fine.)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","That's good. Can I tell you something?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Okay.)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","I think I like you.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Really?!)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Oh, that's great!)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","No, that's not good.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(That's not good?)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","No. See, if I start to like you too much,  I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country.  Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again.  And that would devastate me. So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KENNY","(Aaaargh!)","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"A BOY","I'm not.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Who's not?!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"A BOY","Me.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Benny, will you hold my hand?  I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"EL PRESIDENTE","Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.)","rainforest-schmainforest",32

"KYLE","Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","We are?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR TEACHER","Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Oh, really? Could you brush it off?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Um, no.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!!  Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here.  Oh my God!!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KELLY","Me, too!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Aaaaa! There's a dude here!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost.  Cah heh, can you help us?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"SOLDIER","ü¾™¦ˆ¼Quü¾Ž–”¼?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Y taco.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","I want two tostadas and mild sauce.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CARTMAN","Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"STAN","This doesn't look very safe.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Now kids, let's be a bit more ""open-minded."" I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a ""people's army."" They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government.  Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest.  We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San Josü¾Ž–”¼?  Um...  Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift.. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KIDS","Honh.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography.  Oh, Kyle, please!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"KYLE","Hey!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Run, children, run!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"EL PRESIDENTE","ü¾Œ–„¼ü¾™¦ˆ¼Donde putos estü¾Œ–”¼ el coro?! ü¾Œ–„¼El espectü¾Œ–”¼culo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)","rainforest-schmainforest",32

"MISS STEVENS","Hello?? Anybody?? Hellp??","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"CHOIR BOY","Wow, look at the pretty flower.","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay?","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"JAKE","Aaaah. Ugh, help!","rainforest-schmainforest",32
"MISS STEVENS","Ga-ow!","rainforest-schmainforest",32

"CARTMAN","Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool.","spontaneous-combustion",33

"STAN","Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Then I can give it to my dad.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"TOWNSMAN","You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Exactly.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.","spontaneous-combustion",33

"RANDY","I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.","spontaneous-combustion",33

"KYLE","Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Wall, actally, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dude, he's still not dead.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.","spontaneous-combustion",33

"THE MAYOR","My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","You wanted to see me, Mayor?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","All right, all right. Name your price.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","Done. Just find out what's happening.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Hey you guys. Seriously.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","What the-?  Oh, what now?!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Chef! Chef!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","Children, what the hell are you doin'?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","What?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","It's really gonna piss you off.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","What?!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CHEF","This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Oh, damnit!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dad, where's the phone book?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed.  Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"JESUS","Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. Caller, you're on the air.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Stan?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"JESUS","That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Oh.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"JESUS","Do you have an opinion on global warming?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Uh, it... sucks ass.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"JESUS","Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto.  Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Awww crap.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"TOWNSMAN","Go get him!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"WOMAN","It's out of control.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","Boy, they're really pissed.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Hey!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Oh my God, what's going on?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Mr. Garrison, help me!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"MR. GARRISON","I, I do not know you, sir.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Yeah, take that!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dude, that's my dad!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","...Oh, yeah. Sorry.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"ANCHOR","The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more peopel go back to holding in all their farts.  Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Ije, I I don't know what to say.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"ANCHOR","What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Dude, those people are pissed!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","I know, huh?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Where's your dad?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"BOB DOLE","Having a hard time with male potency? Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"BLONDE","Are you a lawyer?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"BLONDE","We want to sue Randy Marsh.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"BLONDE","He gave us skin cancer.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"BRUNETTE","Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","What are you doing, dad?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Hm. Really?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","What?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Dude, that was Star Trek again.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Huh?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","All right. Now, let's get to work.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dad. Dad!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Wow!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","...Right, right right.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","She's upstairs.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"CARTMAN","Hello-o.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Uh. Please, everyone-","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"RANDY","I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"THE MAYOR","And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","See? My dad is the coolest after all.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","Well, my dad is, too.","spontaneous-combustion",33
"STAN","Cartman!","spontaneous-combustion",33
"KYLE","I forgot all about him.","spontaneous-combustion",33

"STAN","That's amazing!","spontaneous-combustion",33

"CARTMAN","Mom, please can we just leave?","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","You're not fat, you're big-boned.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Weak.","the-succubus",34

"CARTMAN","Hi, Dr. Lott","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","How's my little piggy today?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","I just say that because you're my little buddy.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Hop up on the chair.  Don't break it now!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","God damn it!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing.  All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Yes.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","All right, read them out for me.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I am a little piggy.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. I do not know how that happened.  ""I am a little piggy."" Wow! What are the odds of that?  All right, let's get down to business, shall we?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","They look exactly the same.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Just pick one. Or two.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I don't know, two!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Okay. One, or two? One, or two?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Uh, one.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","One, or two? One, or two?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Two.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","No! The answer is one, piggy! One!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ow! I hate you!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.","the-succubus",34
"KENNY","{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.}","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Hey dudes.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Why?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Why do you have to see an eye doctor?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Hey, yeah!  Ow!","the-succubus",34
"THE BOYS","Hey Chef!","the-succubus",34
"WHITE CHEF","Hello there, children.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.","the-succubus",34
"WHITE CHEF","It's time for lunch-e-roo","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Where's Chef?","the-succubus",34
"WHITE CHEF","Chef quit.","the-succubus",34
"THE BOYS","What?!","the-succubus",34
"WHITE CHEF","Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Durp.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Mr. Durp?","the-succubus",34
"MR. DURP","When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Durp.  Ooo! Durp!  Durp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Why did Chef quit?","the-succubus",34
"MR. DURP","Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone.  Oh, I don't feel so good.  Durp!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Could you just hand us some food please?","the-succubus",34
"MR. DURP","Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Durp!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Can I have the yellow with a side of white?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Dude! I hate Mr. Durp!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Shut up, Cartman!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ow!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Oh! Hello there, children!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Yeah, but we didn't believe them.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Well, it's true.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","But why? Why would you quit?","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on kama sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Talked?!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.","the-succubus",34
"WOMAN","Oh! What darling little children.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Children, Veronica is moving in with me.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Moving in?!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","I'm in love.","the-succubus",34
"BOYS","Love?!","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Oh, you knight.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","What the hell is going on?!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","What's the problem?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Oh, I know just the song for you.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","We have a chance to find the sunshine.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","This... is insane.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","That bitch!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","She's stealing Chef from us.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Yeah, so?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","...Yeah, screw that bitch.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Bitch, I hate that bitch!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Good idea.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","All right, we got the test results back, piggy-","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Stop calling me piggy!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","So, what does that mean?","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","That's why we have the little stapler.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ow! Son of a bitch!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","They said that Chef works in one of these buildings","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Dude! Just take them off!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I can't! They're stapled to my head! I hate you guys.","the-succubus",34
"RECEPTIONIST","Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","We wanna talk to Chef.","the-succubus",34
"RECEPTIONIST","Chef?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","He's a big guy, with a beard.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","And a chef hat.","the-succubus",34
"KENNY","{And a real huge dick.}","the-succubus",34
"RECEPTIONIST","Oh! The black guy!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Huh?","the-succubus",34
"RECEPTIONIST","Third cubicle on the left  Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Uh, yeah, sure sure.","the-succubus",34
"RECEPTIONIST","Wow! You really got fat.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ey!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Hello there, children.","the-succubus",34
"KIDS","Hey, Chef.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Eric, you got glasses!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Chef, you have to dump the bitch!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Huh?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","We need you, Chef.","the-succubus",34
"MAN","Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","You bet!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Chef, this place isn't you!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","But we don't like her.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Why not??","the-succubus",34
"STAN","I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","No way, dude!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?","the-succubus",34
"KIDS","Okay!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Chef should be here any minute.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Dude! He bailed on us!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","I can't believe it!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Come on! We're going to his house!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Oh! Uh, hello there, children.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","You forgot!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner.  She's so amazing.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Hello, children!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Oh no! No nononononono!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","This is so wonderful! Let's sing!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","If we can hold on through the night.","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Sure.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, the old succubus syndrome.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","What's a succubus?","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","That's it!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah!","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","This is totally what's happening!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!""","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Thanks, Mr. Garrison.","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Sure, kids.","the-succubus",34
"MR. HAT","You're not fooling anyone!","the-succubus",34
"MR. GARRISON","Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him.","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Oh, no!","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","Now, hon.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Who are you?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","There he is!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Chef, we have to talk to you!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","You're Chef's parents?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","We have to talk to him!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","No, that's okay.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","-and I yelled. I said, ""What do you want from us, monster?!"" And the monster bent down and said, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty.""","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","What's tree-fitty?","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Three dollars and fifty cents.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","He wanted money?","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","That's right. I said ""I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!""","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","She gave him a dollar.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You gave him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Hey! You son of a bitch!","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","All right. Time to laser me a little piggy.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh","the-succubus",34
"DR. LOTT","I bet his mom wishes she could do that.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","August.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","-August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","-And she says to me, ""How would you like to buy some cookies?"" And I said ""Well, what kind do you have?"" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Raisin oatmeal.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","-Raisin oatmeal, and I said ""We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?"" And she looks at me and she says, ""...Uh I need about tree-fitty.""","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","...Tree-fitty.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","The Loch Ness monster.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","I said, ""Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!"" It said, ""how about just two-fitty?"" I said, ""Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!""","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Lord, he was angry.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Damn right, I was angry!","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Aah, shut your mouth, woman!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Sure. That crazy old monster  Now, then the fourth time I saw the...","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.","the-succubus",34
"LIANE","Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right?","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Okay.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","Aaah! It's the succubus!","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Huh?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","We know what you are, lady!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","A what?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Well, you are taking Chef from us.","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","I guess","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow,  And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it!  Toodle-oo!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Jesus dude!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","What? What happened?","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Could I have your attention please? Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady.  I'm very happy for them both.  Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","It's okay, pop.","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Thomas, you're gonna get me going now.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, ""Poppa, poppa!"" I said ""What do you need, Chef, my boy?"", and he said, ""...I need about tree-fitty.""","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","...Tree-fitty.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, ""Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?"" He said, ""My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it."" I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Oh, it was scary!","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","I said, ""Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!""","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Excuse me!  We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","This is not a woman! It is a succubus!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","What?!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him","the-succubus",34
"VERONICA","Children! That hurts my feelings.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Chef, but-","the-succubus",34
"CHEF","No buts, Stan!  I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","So I chased the monster down the street, you see...","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""","the-succubus",34
"STAN","What the hell does that mean?","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","I don't know.","the-succubus",34
"KENNY","(Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Right.","the-succubus",34
"KENNY","(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Yeah?","the-succubus",34
"KENNY","(That's what that means!)","the-succubus",34
"STAN","Oh-hoho!","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","If we can hold on to the night.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","In three hours.","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open.","the-succubus",34
"STAN","We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman??","the-succubus",34
"KYLE","He's asleep. Wake up fatass!","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","What what what?","the-succubus",34
"STAN","God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.","the-succubus",34
"CARTMAN","I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","We had taco salad that night.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, ""What do you want from me, alien?!"" and do you know what he said?","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","Tree-fitty.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, ""tree-fitty."" And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!","the-succubus",34
"NELLIE","He tricked me.","the-succubus",34
"THOMAS","Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!","the-succubus",34
"STAN","There she is!","the-succubus",34

"JUNJUN","Doe-wooop!","jakovasaurs",35
"KYLE","Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.","jakovasaurs",35

"KYLE","Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!","jakovasaurs",35

"MAN","Listen to her!","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.","jakovasaurs",35
"JIMBO","We just encourage them to find someplace better.","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Memphis?","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Yes, Memphis.  You jakovasaurs would love it there.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?","jakovasaurs",35
"JUNJUN","G'ooh-woo-ooop!","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Yeah.","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right?","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Okay, we'll move to Memphis!","jakovasaurs",35
"SOME MEN","Yea!","jakovasaurs",35
"OTHERS","Hooray!","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Hey, Jakov, how's it going?","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Great, Eric! We're moving.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Moving?","jakovasaurs",35

"LIANE","Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.","jakovasaurs",35
"JIMBO","Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.","jakovasaurs",35

"BOY","Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.","jakovasaurs",35
"BOY","Oh! He took care of mom, too.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","You're a nut! Let me see that letter. It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that? Who's laughing?","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Woo, woo!","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Come onn, come on!  Hello!","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from-","jakovasaurs",35

"BARBRADY","Ready.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Ready.","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Okay. Hands on your buzzers.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Forty-seven!","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","You have to wait until I ask the question first.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Sor-ry!","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","That's okay. Hands on buzzers.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Turkey sandwich!","jakovasaurs",35
"BARBRADY","Damn, he's quick!","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","Oh. Sor-ry!","jakovasaurs",35
"BARBRADY","No, I'm sorry.","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","No, it's my fault. I'm sorry.","jakovasaurs",35

"MAYOR","Just don't answer any more questions, got it?","jakovasaurs",35
"BARBRADY","Okie-dokie.","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.","jakovasaurs",35
"STAN","Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.","jakovasaurs",35
"KYLE","We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.","jakovasaurs",35
"KYLE","There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","That's Kenny with branches on his head. Why did you bring me all the out here, you guys?","jakovasaurs",35
"STAN","Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.","jakovasaurs",35
"CARTMAN","Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix!","jakovasaurs",35
"KYLE","Cartman! Wait!","jakovasaurs",35
"KENNY","(Hey you guys, wait up for me!)  (Waaah!)","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","What's two plus two, Jakov?","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","I don't know!","jakovasaurs",35
"BARBRADY","Four?","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Jakov, what is your name?","jakovasaurs",35
"BARBRADY","Jakov","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","Oh, screw it. Jakov wins!","jakovasaurs",35
"JAKOV","I do?","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!","jakovasaurs",35

"CARTMAN","Don't, mother! Just, don't.","jakovasaurs",35
"MAYOR","I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.","jakovasaurs",35
"JIMBO","The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.","jakovasaurs",35
"NED","We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course.","jakovasaurs",35
"JIMBO","Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!","jakovasaurs",35
"NED","I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.","jakovasaurs",35

"CRAIG","No.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we-  Hey! Did you just flip me off?!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","No.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Yes, you did!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Told ya!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"VOICE","Welcome to home ec.  For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KENNY","(Woohooo!)","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WENDY","I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WOMAN","That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers.  But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KENNY","(Woohooo!)","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","I don't know. He's such a wuss.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Do you wanna bet?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I'll bet.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","How much?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Five bucks.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","You're on!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Arrh!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Hey Tweek.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Gaarhrhrh!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","He does?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Why?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Craig, could I talk to you real quick? Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","He did?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Why would he say that?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Well, I've gotta go over there and-","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Okay.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Rrrr! What a jerk!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","He's really got it out for you, dude.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Why?! What did I do?!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","So, do you agree to fight him after school?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","I guess so.","tweek-vs-craig",36

"STAN","Come on, you guys.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","This is gonna be so sweet, dude.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","We'll see!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","You're on, fatass!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KENNY","(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Yeah. That's not cool, dude.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"BEBE","Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"JORDAN","Bye, Kenny.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KENNY","(Bye, ladies.)","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Hey, what's going on?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Really? Cool.  It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","What?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TOKEN","Yeah, they left.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Aw, hell!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Those sons of bitches!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","I guess they don't wanna fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Tweek?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Tweek?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Herr. What do you guys want?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Well, Craig showed up.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","He did?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!""","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","I don't have crooked teeth!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken ; well, everybody in the world saw it!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Everyone in the world?! Rrrr!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Yeah, it was weak.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","I'm not a chicken!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Wait! I'll fight!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Tomorrow?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Okay.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Red Racer's on.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Nnope.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Egh. God-damnit!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","What?! What did he say about Stripe?!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","After Red Racer.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","After Red Racer, of course.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"RICHARD","How was school today, son?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Errh!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"RICHARD","That's great.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??","tweek-vs-craig",36
"RICHARD","Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MOM","It's true. I was.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"RICHARD","Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Well?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MOM","Well what, honey?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Nrr. What happened?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"RICHARD","Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MOM","Yes, I think that's right.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Rrrrr! You guys never help me!  Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"DAD","With who?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Some kid.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"DAD","Oh.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MOM","Don't just ""Oh"" him, Thomas!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","Yeah, don't just ""Oh"" me!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Why?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","We'll use plastic wrap.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Haaarrr!  Aw, God, what am I gonna do?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","However long Craig wants it to last. T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Shut up, fatass!!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE.  It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"BEBE","What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","When I have you guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Huh? Uh, what?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I?  Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","What's that?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","What? She die or something?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"MR. ADLER","What? Hey! Go on!  You're screwing around in here!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","Oh boy! Here we go!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WENDY","What's happening?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Tweek's gonna fight Craig!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WENDY","Oh cool!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Well?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Come on!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WENDY","Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","What do we do?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Huh?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","How?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","How??","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CRAIG","I've never been in a fight before.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Me neither.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CROWD","Awwww.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Aw, dude, come on!!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","You just hit each other, smack each other around.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Not like that!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Like what, then?","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CROWD","Awww.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CLYDE","All that build-up for nothing.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"WENDY","Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"STAN","Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Fine!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"KYLE","Fine!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"CARTMAN","Fine, that's fine!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"JIMBO","Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Rrrrh!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"JIMBO","You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"NED","Mmrr I can still kick ass.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"JIMBO","Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Hwaaah!","tweek-vs-craig",36
"JIMBO","Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing.","tweek-vs-craig",36
"TWEEK","Uugh!","tweek-vs-craig",36

"KENNY","(Why?)","tweek-vs-craig",36
"PEARL","Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.","tweek-vs-craig",36

"HOST","Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season.  The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls.  The female lion relaxes her body and says ""hello"" to Mr. Winky. The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside.  Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed.","cat-orgy",38

"SHELLEY","What?! No you don't!","cat-orgy",38
"CARTMAN","No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.","cat-orgy",38

"SHELLEY","What are you doing?","cat-orgy",38
"CARTMAN","I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelley's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?","cat-orgy",38

"REPORTER","Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house.  According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"PIP","Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks.  The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"DOUGIE","Do you think someday I can be a reporter?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house showing eveidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"PIP","Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"RANDY","I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"RANDY","I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"RANDY","Well, of course we wouldn't.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"RANDY","What?! Why the hell would you do that?!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"RANDY","Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"RANDY","AAAW!!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"BARBARDY","What's the Ganz techique?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"ATF LEAD","This is what we did in Waco.  Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out.  Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GARRISON","That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"STAN","Come on. We have to find out what's happening.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"DOUGIE","See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","So what are your plans, commander?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"BUTTERS","Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","Sh!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"PIP","But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"BUTTERS","Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"STAN","Tell them not to burn us down.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"DOUGIE","Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"PIP","Now what do we do?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"DOUGIE","Hey, I'm a real reporter.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"STAN","You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And backrobs.  Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","Look. You see this? You see this?","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"REPORTER","Yes.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","You see it? You see it? Go get it. Go get it!  Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"RANDY","We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GUEST","Good night, everyone.","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39
"GANZ","Look out!  Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender!","two-guys-naked-in-a-hotub",39

"STAN","Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","This is gonna be fun!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"STAN","Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"KYLE","I don't really care, dude.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"STAN","Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"JONATHAN","Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"FR. MAXI","I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloweenn is an abomination!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"STAN","Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","Shouldn't we hide her better than that?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"STAN","Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"KENNY","(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?)","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Mrs. Broflovski?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Well. Theh- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","Yeahp.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Yes. And, now for the difficult part.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","Brace yourself.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like ü¾³¤¼ an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","...Do?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BLOND","Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DELIVERY MAN","Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DELIVERY MAN","Sign heah, and heah, and heah.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present!  ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner.  Let's see here.  That's good, I'll rewrap it later!  Oh, sweet!

"STAN","Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"STAN","Where's your costume, fatass?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!""","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"STAN","Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! This is gonna be sweet","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"STAN","What's the problem?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","Nno Grandma.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","No Grandma??","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","Nno Grandma.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","She's not here!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"BARBRADY","Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CROWD","Ee-oooh!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"BRUNET","Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demostrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"MAN","Excuse me, how is this helping?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"PIRATE VOICE","Noo! Don't go to the docks!  Aarrrgh! Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay!  Fire the cannon!  Har harharharhar!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CAPTAIN BLY","We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"FR. MAXI","I warned you! I told you this would happen!  When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Hallowen concerts, this is what you get!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DJ","Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"KENNY","(Aw, man!)","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","Somebody took my dead grandma.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"FIELDY","What?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"STAN","We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"KYLE","Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"FIELDY","Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DAVID","They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Huh?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DAVID","""Pirate ghost"" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"MUNKY","No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"FIELDY","You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","But that makes them pirate ghosts.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DAVID","No. It makes them ghost pirates.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"KYLE","Then, you'll help us?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"MR. GARRISON","He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"STAN","How should we split up?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way,  and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"DAVID","Hey, I got an idea.  We should set a groovy trap.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"MUNKY","Good idea.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"CARTMAN","How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"ALL","Puh-puuhh pirate ghost!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"DAVID","Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas.

"FR. MAXI","Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"FR. MAXI","No.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"NIBBLET","Uh oh!","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"JONATHAN","Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41
"ALL","Yeah.","korn's-groovy-pirate-ghost-mystery",41

"KYLE","Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.","chinpokomon",42

"SHARON","I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.","chinpokomon",42
"RANDY","Why?","chinpokomon",42
"SHARON","Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values.","chinpokomon",42
"ROOSTOR","Roo-oo-oostor!","chinpokomon",42

"RANDY","I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.","chinpokomon",42
"SHARON","Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!","chinpokomon",42
"RANDY","Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.","chinpokomon",42
"SHARON","No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what ""Battle Of The Network Stars"" did to an entire generation.","chinpokomon",42
"RANDY","My God, you're right.","chinpokomon",42
"CARTMAN","Come on, brothers and sisters, we've all got to join together.","chinpokomon",42

"LIANE","Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.","chinpokomon",42
"RANDY","Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.","chinpokomon",42
"SHARON","You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.","chinpokomon",42

"PRESIDETN CLINTON","My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.","chinpokomon",42

"CARTMAN","Ey! How come you never pick me?!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. GARRISON","Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MARK","The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"CARTMAN","Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"A VOICE"," A VOICE","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments.  My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"RANDY","Uh, look, Mr....","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","Cotswolds.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"RANDY","Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better.  And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"RANDY","Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"JIMBO","Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"REBECCA","How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","Well, what else would one do?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","Love, for one thing.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","And woowhat is love?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","Woowhat means ""ki-iss""?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. So I cold write about it.  How do we do it?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","I'm not completely sure.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"REBECCA","Should we...  l-look it up?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"REBECCA","Wow. Wow, that was fun!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"KYLE","Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"REBECCA","I'm... having... fun, Mark.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"PIP","Oh, my goodness!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MARK","You're out of control.  You did this to my sister!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"MR. COTSWOLDS","Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MARK","Calm down, papü¾Œ–”¼!  Everything is all right.  You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on.  Don't you see, papü¾Œ–”¼? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anythng sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papü¾Œ–”¼.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"BUTTERS","Well, she sure is.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MARK","I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43
"MR. COTSWOLDS","Mark. You're absolutely right.  Okay, childdren. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.","hooked-on-monkey-fonics",43

"CARTMAN","Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","Cartman!!!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45

"KYLE","Give me the drum, and you play the flute","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","No way! Flutes are totally gay!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KENNY","(Oh. Flutes are gay?)","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","You dick!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Later.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield.  First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MEN","Yes! Woohoo, yea!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna lethim in the reenactment.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","He'll show.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","He'd better!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MEN","Whoa. Mmm.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MR. GARRISON","Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STUART","Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","And now, to clarify how the reenctment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grnandpa Marvin Marsh,  the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","Wow, dude! Your granpa still isn't dead?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Dude, that's not cool.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Good morning, gentlmen.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","Teah! You're dressed up like the South.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","No they're not, stupid!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Yes we are!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","How much do you wanna bet?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Right.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","You're on!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Hoohoo what a d'humbass!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Yeahah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MEN","Yes! Woohoo, yea!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"ANNOUNCER","Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, fron the South ; in blue are the Union, from the North .","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appmattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Forward!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"RANDY","Let's bring those Confederate bastards down!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45

"SOLDIERS","Huh? Wha-?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","What the hell?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"RANDY","He took the bell!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Hooray for the South!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Cartman, you can't do that!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","God damnit! Now we have to start over!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Alrighty everyone.  We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help, Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","But why? Why should they get the bell?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","But we don't have to lose.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","What??","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Gentlemen, we can win this battle! Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!""","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","By God, he's right!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MR. GARRISON","Jimbo!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenacters have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenacters! Well, I'm sick of it!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STUART","I'm tired of losing this battle!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MEN","Yeah!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MAN","Yeah!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45

"MR. GARRISON","You Yankee sons of bitches!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"RANDY","Ow! That hurt!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"GRANDPA","God damnit, what the hell are they doing?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","What do we do?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45

"JIMBO","Aw, come on. Have a little sip.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","You cheated, Cartman!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STAN","Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"KYLE","Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"RANDY","All I'm saying is that... is is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MR. GARRISON","That ain't true! The Confederates would have shupped ass in Topeka, too!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"BARTENDER","Yeah.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MAN","Yeah.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","Perhaps we should take Topeka.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Huh?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","They don't?!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","No. I say we take Topeka.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"RANDY","Huh?","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"STUART","That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"MR. GARRISON","I'll bet we could!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","I'll bet we could, too!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","I'll bet you can't.","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","What?!  Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"CARTMAN","I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45
"JIMBO","Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!","the-red-badge-of-gayness",45

"KYLE","You got your what?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another.  But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CRAIG","Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park.  Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love.  Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"BOY","He's neat, Mommy.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CRAIG","Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? Can I help you with something?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CRAIG","...Well, it's... the millennium, Jesus.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"STAN","No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KYLE","Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's eve, then screw him anyways.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"KENNY","(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KENNY","(Woo-hoo!)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"JESUS","Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"KENNY","(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Tampon? What's a tampon?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"JESUS","...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded!  So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"CHEF","...Is that what I said?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year old boy! I'm gonna do someting about it!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"ROD","Hullo-o-o.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Hey, Rod, great to see you.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"ROD","Oh.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"ROD","Pooped pants.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","What?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"ROD","Pooped pants.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"DR. MEPHESTO","Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. MEPHESTO","Your father never went through puberty?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarassed to come himself.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. MEPHESTO","Oh, I can't say that I blame him.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","So do you know anything that can help him?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. MEPHESTO","Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Hormones?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. MEPHESTO","Yes!  Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"STAN","Hey assholes!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KYLE","Hormones?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KYLE","Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","So what are we gonna do for New Year's?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KENNY","(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KENNY","(Oh- ooowww!)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"KENNY","(Aaaaaa!)","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KYLE","Whoa, dude!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","Mr. and Ms. McCormick.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MCCORMICK PARENTS","Yes?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MS. MCCORMICK","Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STUART","What happened? What killed him, doctor?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MS. MCCORMICK","Oh my God.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MS. MCCORMICK","Gi-ih","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"DR. DOCTOR","We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to carch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","What??","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CRAIG","How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow?  ...Hello?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"STAN","No. I didn't, but-","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CARTMAN","Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentelmen, as promised, Mr. Rod ""Do You Think I'm Sexy?"" Stewart!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"JESUS","Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"RANDY","We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"SKEETER","Llet's get him!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"CRAIG","Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as ""the gayest party ever."" Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Jesus, why does God hate me?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","What do you mean?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems.  A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence.  That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","I just wanted my period.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own.  I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MAN","Whoa, what is that??","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"WOMAN","Look, I can see him.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Father. You came.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me.  Be ye not afraid.  Blessed art thou, my children.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"RANDY","That's God?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"JESUS","Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega.  The Beginning and the End.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MR. GARRISON","Well, yeah, but that??","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"MR. GARRISON","...Well not like that!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Only one?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"SHARON","What should we ask him?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"STAN","I have it. I have the question.  Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?!","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"KYLE","How do know that?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man ü¾³¤¼ with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"MR. GARRISON","Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"GOD","I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000.","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47
"STAN","Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay.  I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?","are-you-there-god,-it's-me,-jesus!",47

"KENNY","(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"STAN","Uh, Butters, could we have it?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"BUTTERS","Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under- my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"CARTMAN","Okay.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Good night.  What do you have there, Eric?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","I know, huh?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Did the tooth fairy come?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"CARTMAN","Do you what this means?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"A DENTIST","Dentist office.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","About a hundred and twelve.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","...A hundred and twelve.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Your son wouldn't happen to be an ""alligator,"" would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"CARTMAN","Tih-  Tooth?  What the hell? Mom!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Yes, Eric","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down.  Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","No, honey. It's just-","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LIANE","Eric! Eric, wait!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","No, Mother! No more lies!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Dude, where's the money?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","There is no money.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","No more money??","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","I know!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Cartman, what's going on?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","You guys...  Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Tell us what?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","What do you mean, ""there's no tooth fairy?""","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Dude.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Kyle, open your eyes, man!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","It's not true!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Oh my God! You did lie to me.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Peter Pan, too??","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","What about Moses and Abraham?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Probably?! Is Atlantis real??","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Wahahahah!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","No, man, that's just a TV show.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","You guys! You guys! I figured it out!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","What? That your parents lied to you, too?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","How?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","The kid will never even know.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Oh my God, what if I'm not real?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Yeah.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Come on, Kyle!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","What if this is all just somebody's dream?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Wow, look at the size of these houses!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Got it.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","This is the smartest business venture ever.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","What the-?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","...Hey, you can't do that!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Because that's what we're doing!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Yeah! You ripped off our idea!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"KYLE","Two years?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"BLOND","Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"BLOND","How dare you!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","You scram! We were here first!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"RICH KID","What's going on?  Oh! It's the tooth fairies!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","You woke him up!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"RICH KID","I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"ALL","Shut up!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Who's the Boss?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Uuh, yeah.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","We were there first!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years.  I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Damnit! And we thought we were so original!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Well, uh-what do you mean?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","What's a ""tooth trade?""","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved.  We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months.  Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"THE SOUTH PARK BOYS","Wow!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries , hockey games , anywhere we can find them","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality.  But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Amazing.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"CARTMAN","Man, that is tits!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","And now my only problem is, what do I do with you?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","Oh. Uh-I don't know.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","It's that, or else I can cut off your penises.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"KYLE","Cartman!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"STAN","How much do we get if we work for you?","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"LOOGIE","I'll cut you in at 2%.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"DR. ROBERTS","Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this.  A giant half-chickenhalf-squirrel that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest  for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra , and that it-","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DENTIST","Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"MR. FOLEY","I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"MR. FOLEY","It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Where?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"MR. FOLEY","In Montreal.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","And where, pray, is this ""Montreal""?!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"MR. FOLEY","Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"MR. FOLEY","Well, I will!","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49
"DR. ROBERTS","Anyway, the half-chickenhalf-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.","the-tooth-fairy's-tats-2000",49

"GREG NIMINS","Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","What the hell are they doing?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GREG NIMINS","The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN",":	We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God damnit!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Hello?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GIRL IN PINK","Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Son of a bitch!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"DRIVER","Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"WARDEN","Prisoner 24601, arriving.  Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500.  Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband.  At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Huh-who's Romper Stomper?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","I am!  And I don't want no new cellmate!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"WARDERN","You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Oh, I will!  You bet your ass I will.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"BUTTERS","...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","Huh?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","I'm not fat.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Yeah, fatss! Get your fat butt on the sled!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GIRL IN PINK","See you Saturday, poo sniffers!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Nice going, fat boy!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Well, well, well. Nwe fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"INMATES","Yeah!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","...Neither do we","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Oh, thank you, Jesus.  So we're friends now?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in ""friends.""","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"INMATES","Yeah!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks , but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"PIP","Oh, that's a wonderful idea.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","So I don't get to be on the team now?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ALL THE BOYS","Shut up, fatass!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50

"STAN","Come on, let's get it a try.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Yeah-","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Dude, bail! Bail!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KENNY","(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","We killed Kenny?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","We Killed Kenny. We're bastards.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"BUTTERS","Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"PIP","This is a sad day for men everywhere.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ALL THE BOYS","Yeup.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50

"GIRL IN PINK","Woohoo. Great time, girls.  Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"SOME BOYS","Oh?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"OTHER BOYS","Huh?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","How?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Sweet! Let's go!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50

"STAN","Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. So we made you this cake.  There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","A what?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","An ailnay ilefay.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Wwhat's that?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Yeah, you stupid umbassday!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","...Yeah.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Sshh!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race,  then I need those cigarettes.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","How are we supposed to give them to you?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Alright, here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Well, okay... here... l'see...","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Me too.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","So now what do we do?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Well, did you get the cigarettes?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. One.  Heh, two.  Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh  yeahhh. Hoh. Phew.  Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","You flushed them?!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Son of a bitch!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Yeah.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Hi. Can Token come out and play?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Killer.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","No.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","Yeah.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","It's not?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Damnit! Son of a bitch, damnit!  Oh, sorry.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Huh?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Why not?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. Ew, it smells, man.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","But you said-","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","I thought that-","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house.  Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw  Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess.  Hey. Uh, what are you doing?  You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","I want my Mo-omm","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Dude.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Mommy, I want my Mommy!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","You will?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"AIDE","Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GOVERNOR","Naw, not another committee. Send them in.  This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","Yeah.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GOVERNOR","Well, boys, what can I do for you?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Okay, go ahead and start.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","I don't start, you start.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocracy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","And we think that that is  a savage hypocracy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","That is our presentation. An idea that we call...","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"TOKEN","""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocracy.""","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GOVERNOR","Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us!  Mph. Oowww!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","What's the matter?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","It's my leg! I think it's broken. You go on ahead without me.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Uhokay.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Hey.  You're supposed to say, ""I'm not going without you,"" or something.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Oh. Really?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Okay.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","No! You're supposed to say, ""I can't take these,"" or something, dumbass!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Oh. I can't take these.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Take them. They'll bring you luck. Now go on. Get out of here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","Romper?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"ROMPER STOMPER","Yeah?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GUARD","Alright, freeze!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GUARD","But you've been pardoned by the governor!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GIRL IN PINK","Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","He's gotta show up. He's just got to.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GIRL IN PINK","Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"BEBE","Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","Dude, I guess we've jsut got to try it without him.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Alright, where's Clyde.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","Right here.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"STAN","Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"KYLE","On the sled, fatass!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"GIRL IN PINK","Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"OTHER GIRLS","Yeah!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50

"BOY SLEDDERS","Hooray!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","That's right! I'm back!","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CLYDE","Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back!  Thank you so much. Thank you.","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50
"CARTMAN","What the hell's wrong with Clyde?","cartman's-silly-hate-crime-2000",50

"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes, of course.","timmy-2000",51
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","What??","timmy-2000",51
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.","timmy-2000",51
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Oh!","timmy-2000",51
"TIMMY","Timmiihh!","timmy-2000",51
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Well, that certainly would explain it.","timmy-2000",51

"TIMMY","Oolih oo livn' a lie, Timmehuh!","timmy-2000",51

"TIMMY","Timmih!","timmy-2000",51

"CLINIC DOCTOR","This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!","timmy-2000",51
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.","timmy-2000",51
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","What can we do for him, doctor?","timmy-2000",51

"MR. GARRISON","That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!","timmy-2000",51
"TIMMY","Timmih.","timmy-2000",51
"MR. GARRISON","Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.","timmy-2000",51

"KURT LODER","Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy , the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS","Well, I think the sad question is, ""Where are the parents in all this?"" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.","timmy-2000",51
"KURT LODER","And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit.","timmy-2000",51

"SKYLER","Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS","Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.","timmy-2000",51

"SKYLER","The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.","timmy-2000",51
"TIMMY","Timmiihh!","timmy-2000",51
"SKYLER","And the Lords of the Underworld!","timmy-2000",51
"TIMMY","Timmiihh!","timmy-2000",51

"MARK","Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.","timmy-2000",51
"SKYLER","Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm novin' on!  I don't need Timmy!  I'm goin' solo!","timmy-2000",51

"KYLE","You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.","timmy-2000",51
"CARTMAN","I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.","timmy-2000",51

"KYLE","Bastard.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin.","timmy-2000",51
"RANDY","Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternatives to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doing really amazing kids with children who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape.","timmy-2000",51
"DR. SHAY","Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder.  This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.","timmy-2000",51
"GIRL","I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara-  Ah!","timmy-2000",51
"DR. SHAY","Sit down and study!","timmy-2000",51
"DR. SHAY","Sit down and study!","timmy-2000",51
"DR. SHAY","Stop crying and do your schoolwork! If you would like more information on my bold new treatment, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, ""You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again."" Thank you.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.","timmy-2000",51
"SHARON","That video had pretty colors.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","What the? Damnit, have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!","timmy-2000",51
"PARENTS","Yes.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Awww, fudge it!","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","The what??","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.","timmy-2000",51
"PARENTS","Yes.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Oh my God!!","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Come, see him with us.","timmy-2000",51
"CARTMAN","Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera agan! She's on my back! Hah!","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn phramacist!","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","That's easily another twenty grand apiece!","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Hey, open this damn door.","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","Can I help you?","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","Huh?","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","Eh wuh, what??","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they'er actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","Mm- my God. What have we done??","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","Well, if I had known... Phl Collins, uh, my God!","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Then we need an antidote!","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","Yes, of course.","timmy-2000",51
"CLINIC DOCTOR","Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?","timmy-2000",51
"PHARMACIST","I have some right here.  It's a compound called ""Ritalout.""","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick!","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS"," PHIL COLLINS","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children.","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS","Last night I went, ""O!""","timmy-2000",51
"RANDY","Wasn't that great, son?","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","Sure was, Dad.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me.","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice.","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS","I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitlted, ""You'll Be In... Me."" Thanks.","timmy-2000",51
"CHEF","Come on, drink it down. It's free.","timmy-2000",51

"PHIL COLLINS","Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Yeah!","timmy-2000",51
"PHIL COLLINS","You just wanna laugh at him.","timmy-2000",51
"STAN","No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!","timmy-2000",51
"KYLE","Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!","timmy-2000",51
"AUDIENCE","Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!","timmy-2000",51

"SKYLER","They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.","timmy-2000",51
"MARK","Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again?","timmy-2000",51
"SKYLER","I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head...","timmy-2000",51
"TIMMY","Timmih!","timmy-2000",51
"JONESY","Wow. They really are chanting for us.","timmy-2000",51

Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes.  If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more , you can feed them fishsticks.","quintuplets-2000",52

"OFFICER BARBRADY","Who are you?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MAN","We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MAN","Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"OTHER NAMBLA MEN","Yeah, uh-huh.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"OTHER NAMBLA MEN","Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Okay people , I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MAN","All these men wanted was to love a young boy!  There is nothing wrong with love!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MR. GARRISON","I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MAN","You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong.  Come on, men!","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"DR. MEPHESTO","I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone chese.  Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- Who could that be?  Why, it's little Eric Cartman.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Dr. Mephesto, I need help.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"DR. MEPHESTO","Well of course, come in.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"DR. MEPHESTO","Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"DR. MEPHESTO","Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"DR. MEPHESTO","Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"DR. MEPHESTO","Sure!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MAN","Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MEMBERS","Awwww.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"NAMBLA LEADER","And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and womens are protected under civil-rights laws,  we want the same!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MEMBERS","Yeah.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"EAGER MAN","Yeh-hehah-hah.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"NAMBLA LEADER","What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a-  Can we... help you?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"CARTMAN","Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","What are you talking about, fatass?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"STUART","Well, I can still drink.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KENNY","(No! Daddy!)","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"STUART","Oh my God, it killed Kenny!","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"KENNY","(Huh. Huh??)  (That does it!)","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'?  Uh what are you doing, Kenny?  Kenny, what are you going to plunge?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KENNY","(AAAARRRRHHH!)","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Aaaaaaah!  AAAAA!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"STUART","Kenny, what the hell are you doing?!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"STAN","We got invited too, fatass","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Hunh.  Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"NAMBLA LEADER","Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"PATRICK","And his skin is as soft as fresh linen.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"MEPHESTO","Yes.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"LEAD AGENT","The North American ManBoy Love Association?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MEPHESTO","What? No!  We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"BLOND AGENT","Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"MR. GARRISON","Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"CARTMAN","They're all over the place.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"TIMMY","Timmiihhh!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"TOKEN","What are we gonna do?!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"STAN","Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"THE BOYS","Yeah.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","How?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"BUTTERS","Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"LEAD AGENT","We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"NAMBLA LEADER","Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called ""freedom."" They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live.  You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","Dude. You have sex with children.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"NAMBLA LEADER","We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","Dude. You have sex with children.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"STAN","Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","Seriously.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"LEAD AGENT","Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","Well, Cartman","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Well, what?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"KYLE","Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"THE BOYS","Yeah!","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"STAN","And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"CARTMAN","No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long.","cartman-joins-nambla",53
"PARAMEDIC","Okay, let's roll.","cartman-joins-nambla",53

"MR. WYLAND","Okay, and where iiiiss... Kenny McCormick?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","(Here.)  Oh, hoho. Ow.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Dude, what the hell was that?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Huh?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Not with me, man.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"STAN","He's fakin'!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. WYLAND","Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"THE CLASS","Awww.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","He's fakin'!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. WYLAND","Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. WYLAND","I don't care! Get down here and do it!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BUTTERS","Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Now, that's a get-well card!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHAIRMAN","Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","What??","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BOARD MEMBER","Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHAIRMAN","Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHAIRMAN","...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about.  It's your somewhat substantial police record.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, whatever!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","That was not me, that was Mr. Hat!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BOARD MEMBER","All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little  ""child molestation"" thing dies down a bit.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHAIRMAN","We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun...","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHAIRMAN","Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Hello, sweetie.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Go on, Butters!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BUTTERS","Ho, I don't wanna!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Butters, go on!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BUTTERS","Oh, uhuh alright, then.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Dude, you really are sick, huh?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KYLE","I don't know, I...","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named ""Miss Information.""","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BUTTERS","Can I go now?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","I've always wanted to write a novel.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well, there you go, m'kay?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","But I never know what to write about.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Besides teaching?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","...Poontang.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","M, m'kay","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON","Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SSHEILA","Toxins?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","All the horrible food we eatü¾³¤¼the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a  toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Uh excuse ne, but, what do these toxins look like?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","What?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Don't be a smartass, Stanley.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MR. GARRISON"," MR. GARRISON","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MRS. TWEEK","Oh my, he looks terrible.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BLONDE MOTHER","Yes, poor little dear.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Good morning, everyone.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"BLONDE MOTHER","Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Huuuuuuuuuh  Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","What?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Oh, that's great news!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Ooooo.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Those aren't toxins. That's the been with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Don't be a smartass?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"OTHER MOTHERS","I agree. Yeah. That's right.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"NURSE","Mr. Marsh is here to see you.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","Alright, send him in.  Oh, Stanley.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Hi, doctor.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","How can I help you?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust intuuuh holistic medicine..","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","But I don't think it's working.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Who?  Oh, shit.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(No, no.)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser  so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) (There! It's mine!)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"LIANE","Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Yeah.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"LIANE","Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Okay, mom.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"LIANE","And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","What's goin' on, guys?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Cartman, we have to ask you a quuestion. A very serious question.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Oh-kay.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Uh huh.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Oh, I think I see where this is going.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Stan, why don't you just ask the question?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN"," CARTMAN","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","But you only need one, fat boy!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","No no, no no, nono no!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Not when I try to tell him!)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Oh my God!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KYLE","How much?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Ten million dollars??)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Oh, look eveyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARLOS RAMIREZ","Oohh, oh yeah. Aah...  Here, uh, this is a ahh dream...catcher.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hairü¾³¤¼now that sounds natural.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARLOS RAMIREZ","Oh yeah, the earth is great.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARLOS RAMIREZ","uh'hm, ho ho hm.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk.  Come on.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARLOS RAMIREZ","Oh yah. You too and junk.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CHIEF RUNNING PINTO","That's funny, man.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","That's right.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"MISS INFORMATION","Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic modicine is about NATURE. Two-hundered and thrity-three dollars.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what thry're talking about?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","And that has something to do with their medicines because...?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"SHARON","Enough, Stanley!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(I know.)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Uh huh.)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do.  Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KENNY","(Rrrh!)","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"CARTMAN","whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","You suck, Cartman!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"STAN","God-damnit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"PUBLISHER","It is.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"DR. DOCTOR","Oh, I see.  Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery.  If you'll just sign this release.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Thank you.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"KYLE","Better, I think.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","You look a lot better.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"STAN","Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"CARTMAN","Huh?","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"STAN","It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put catchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54
"DR. DOCTOR","Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.","cherokee-hair-tampons",54

"JIMBO","Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag.  and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Yeah!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","No, because it's their history!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you , THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!","chef-goes-nanners",55

"MAYOR","Oh, boy.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CLASS","Aaaaah!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year.  Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been... Cartman.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Thaaat's ri-ight.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!","chef-goes-nanners",55

"CARTMAN","Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Told ya.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","This is about history, kids.  If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD!  -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not  ""politically correct."" Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL!  Aand then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"NED","Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Yeah, we got it.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"RANDY","Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion.  That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","We'll march with you, Chef.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters.  Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Thursday's no good, we've got chior council.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","What about next Sunday?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Fine! Next Sunday!","chef-goes-nanners",55

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yeah, I think that's the best day.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Okay! On Saturday, we march!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","To bring down the South Park Flag!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, childen, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stary, and half think the flag should be changed.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the ""Flag Should Stay The Way It Is"" team?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Yeah, me neither.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Nooo!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Islam??","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","From now on, my name is  Abdul Mohammed Jabar  Rauf Kareem Ali.  With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","You WHAT?!  You don't think they should change the flag?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Not really.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","But nothin'!  ""But"" my ass! Fix your own damn food!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","It's okay, I'm here.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","What??","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BUTTERS","Wwuhuh-o-kay!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CLYDE","Right.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Mmmm.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","The South Park flag!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?","chef-goes-nanners",55

"CHEF","...Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag!  In the 1960's there was a monk  who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice!  To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing!","chef-goes-nanners",55

"MAYOR","Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case.  We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen?  There. Is that better?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","No, damnit!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","No, but look! He's got a little smile now!  See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think?  Well, some people just won't with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JOHNSON","Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"ASSISTANT","We... could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","You won't let me help.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","...Touchü¾Ž–”¼. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just... tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"KENNY","(Ah, fuck you!)","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"KENNY","(Kyle, can I have a drink of water?)","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Pretty good, I guess.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Do you think they should change the flag?","chef-goes-nanners",55

"REPORTER","On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote.

"THE KKK","Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Uh huh.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Why don't we just talk about the swastika?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Huh?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,... obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Yeah.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Cool.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"JIMBO","Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KKK MEMBERS","Yeah, m-hm.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KKK MEMBERS","Right, yeah.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.","chef-goes-nanners",55

"KKK LEADER","Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, ""Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?""","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KKK MEMBERS","Yeah, woohoo!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"NED","Mm-yup.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy?  Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess.  Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BEBE","Sure, what?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BEBE","AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","I know.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BEBE","Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BEBE","Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, ""sexual tension."" Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","You mean, I should kiss him?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"BEBE","Kiss him and get it out of your system.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Oh God.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club.  I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the ""Flag Should Be Changed"" team.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the... the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we- ah...  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"PEOPLE IN AUDIENCE","Oh.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"REALLY SHOCKED MAN","Oh, God!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Yes. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the bieginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Huh?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Ooooooohhh?!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","W-we really didn't see it that way.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","But that's a black man up there!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Y-yeah, but... the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Well of course it matters when-  ...Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","What?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MR. WYLAND","What?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actuallih they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"A FEW PEOPLE","Awww.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"SOME KKK MEMBERS","Awww.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Yeah.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan menbers. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flagü¾³¤¼something that everybody can be happy with.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"AUDIENCE MEMBERS","Ooh, huhuh. Oooh","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?","chef-goes-nanners",55
"MAYOR","This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week.  Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"STAN","Wait, I don't get it.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"KYLE","No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CHEF","Hooray!","chef-goes-nanners",55
"JIMBO","I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"WENDY","Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.","chef-goes-nanners",55
"CARTMAN","Me, too!","chef-goes-nanners",55

"CARTMAN","Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives.  God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"STAN","Dude, we don't have any musical talent.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"KENNY","(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"KYLE","Wait a minute. There's only four of us.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","So?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"KYLE","So, all boy bands have five members.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","What?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"KYLE","*N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids On The Block. All had five members.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"STAN","He's right.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"STAN","Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"CARTMAN","I just don't know what I'm gonna do. Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CHEF","Alright, Eric, what's the matter?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CHEF","Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, Boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","What's the Gomlich effect.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CHEF","The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming.""","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","So how do boy bands use that?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CHEF","All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazih! Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","Thanks!","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CHEF","You're welcome. Now, go away!  A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","Cucumber in the pants. Got it.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang. Oh my God."" Okay?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"BEBE","Are we gonna get paid now, or after?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"CARTMAN","I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"THE OTHER GIRLS","Yeah.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"THE GIRLS","...Matt Lauer.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"STAN","Dad? What the hell is going on?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","...I was- ...I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store.in Denver. I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"PRODUCER","Kid, can I talk to you?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","Uh sure.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"RANDY","Ohh, thanks.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"PRODUCER","Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"PRODUCER","Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I-","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"PRODUCER","I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"TOW TRUCK DRIVER","See ya.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"STAN","Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the womenü¾³¤¼all it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then ssspitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops! Now we wander the earth in disarrayü¾³¤¼us, New Kids On The Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And THAT... is why you can't go to the mall!","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"RANDY","Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"STAN","Yeah.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"STAN","Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56
"RANDY","Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.","something-you-can-do-with-your-finger",56

"STAN","Are we gonna go to hell?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Yeah, what if we haven't?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works.  The priest will give you this round cracker,  and he will say, ""The Body of Christ,"" and then you eat it.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Jesus was made of crackers?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","No.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","But crackers are his- body.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Yes.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"KENNY","(What?!)","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, ""eat this, for it is my body.""","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Nononono!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"BUTTERS","Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","The Body of Christ!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","No!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","No??","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"BUTTERS","Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"CARTMAN","Nno!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Then stop questioning me.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confeesion.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","Confession?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"CHRIS","We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"CHRIS","Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself.  Oops! Aw, butternuts!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"STAN","Have you confessed all your sins yet?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"SATAN","I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more more attracted to.  In what way?  Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"SATAN","Oh, Chris! Rraarr!  Rraahh!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CHRIS","Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"STAN","Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Huh?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Who's in there?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Well, here goes everything.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"PRIEST MAXI","Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"KENNY","(Hey, dude.)","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","God damnit!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"KENNY","(What??)","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Oh, hello, children.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","We have a question.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Okay, shoot.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","Where do handicapped people go when they die?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest.  I'll see if I can find him. Bye.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"PRIEST MAXI","Your  con- confession does not leave this box.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"PRIEST MAXI","Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"PRIEST MAXI","I... see.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help. Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SISTER ANNE","Father! I need to talk to you. Father! I have to ask you a question.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"CARTMAN","Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"STAN","What happened??","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CARTMAN","I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CHRIS","Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"IKE","No-o-o.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"KYLE","Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"SADDAM","Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SATAN","It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SADDAM","Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"CHRIS","Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57
"SADDAM","An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!","do-the-handicapped-go-to-hell",57

"HELL DIRECTOR","Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.","probably",58
"SOLDIER","I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness. Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.","probably",58
"HELL DIRECTOR","I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.","probably",58
"CROWD","Awww.","probably",58
"HELL DIRECTOR","So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan!","probably",58
"SATAN","Oooyeah!","probably",58
"CROWD","Aaaaahh!","probably",58
"SATAN","Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh...  muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry.","probably",58
"HELL DIRECTOR","Uh, okay. Thank you Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...","probably",58

"CARTMAN","Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon.","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Sister, have you read this book.","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their llives.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","No.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus!","probably",58

"SADDAM","Is this some kind of trick?","probably",58

"SADDAM","Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick.  Okay, let's walk.","probably",58
"CHRIS","Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.","probably",58
"SADDAM","Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?!","probably",58
"CHRIS","Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just- try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.","probably",58
"SADDAM","You know what I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy!","probably",58
"CHRIS","Aaaah!  Oh God!","probably",58
"SADDAM","Ah hahaha!","probably",58
"CHRIS","Nooo! Agh!","probably",58
"SADDAM","Aaaaaah!","probably",58

"BLONDE GIRL","Wow, that really sucks.","probably",58
"SATAN","I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.","probably",58
"BLONDE GIRL","Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.","probably",58
"SATAN","Who?","probably",58
"BLONDE GIRL","God.","probably",58
"SATAN","God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.","probably",58
"BLONDE GIRL","Well then, maybe it's time.","probably",58
"KIDS","Do dodo dum do dodo. Do dodo dum do dodo.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","For he is Lord, Lord Lord Lord. Where are you from, little boy?","probably",58

"MORMONS","Alright. Yeah.","probably",58
"MORMONS","Ooooo!","probably",58
"SATAN","Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?","probably",58
"MORMONS","Me, too. Uh huh.","probably",58
"SATAN","Great. Thanks.","probably",58
"SATAN","Ah. Hello? g-God? It's uh... Satan.","probably",58
"GOD","Yea. Look upon me, and know me.","probably",58
"SATAN","Hi, God.","probably",58
"GOD","Hello, Satan.  It's- been a long time.","probably",58
"SATAN","Yeah.","probably",58
"GOD","What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?","probably",58
"SATAN","No, I hae a problem, and I- need your advice.","probably",58
"GOD","You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the earth?","probably",58
"SATAN","No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein , was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Halleluyah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah , and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now!","probably",58
"STAN","Dude, that seems- kind of- weird.","probably",58
"KYLE","Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.","probably",58
"SATAN","Heh-and now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.","probably",58
"GOD","Jesus, what the hell happened to you?","probably",58
"SATAN","Huh?","probably",58
"GOD","You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.","probably",58
"SATAN","Well, I just don't know which one to pick.","probably",58
"GOD","No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them.  And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.","probably",58
"SATAN","God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.","probably",58
"GOD","Bingo.","probably",58
"SATAN","Hey- Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.","probably",58
"GOD","It was nice to see you again, Satan.","probably",58
"SATAN","You too.","probably",58
"GOD","Good-bye.","probably",58
"SATAN","Uh, no, I need to be getting back.","probably",58
"SATAN","Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really- gotta go.","probably",58
"MORMONS","Oooo, yeah. I'll do that.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!","probably",58
"STAN","What worked?","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Eheverybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!","probably",58
"KYLE","You're keeping that money yourself?","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.","probably",58
"STAN","Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?","probably",58
"CARTMAN","It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.","probably",58
"STAN","Well, what about going to hell and all that?!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.","probably",58
"KYLE","Then why didn't you tell us?!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!","probably",58
"KYLE","The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Suck my balls!","probably",58
"STAN","Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.","probably",58
"SADDAM","Die, pussy!","probably",58
"CHRIS","Ow!","probably",58

"SATAN","Guys, guys, guys!  Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision.","probably",58
"CHRIS","You have?","probably",58
"SATAN","Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.","probably",58
"SATAN","Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want.  So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself.","probably",58
"CHRIS","Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?","probably",58
"SATAN","No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!","probably",58
"CHRIS","Fine.","probably",58
"SADDAM","Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh!","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","Alright kids, it's time to go! It's time for this to stop!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Sister Anne is a blasphemer!","probably",58
"SISTER ANNE","I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else.","probably",58
"KIDS","Wow!","probably",58
"BUTTERS","Jesus!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Uh oh.","probably",58
"JESUS","Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Jesus, ixnay on the oolschay.","probably",58
"JESUS","God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!","probably",58
"BEBE","Let's go ice-skating.","probably",58
"OTHER KIDS","Yea.","probably",58
"BUTTERS","Uhwe can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.","probably",58
"BOY","Yeah.","probably",58
"CARTMAN","No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!","probably",58
"KYLE","Serves you right, Cartman!","probably",58
"STAN","Yeah!","probably",58
"JESUS","But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson! I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!","probably",58
"CARTMAN","You're gonna send me to hell?","probably",58
"JESUS","No. Worse!","probably",58
"KENNY","(Eric! Eric!)","probably",58
"CARTMAN","Aw, crap!","probably",58
"SATAN","Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.","probably",58
"RICK","Hi, Satan.","probably",58
"SADDAM","There you are!","probably",58
"SATAN","Awgh. Not again.","probably",58
"SADDAM","You know you can't live without me. Now GET THAT ASS BACK TO BED!","probably",58
"SATAN","Saddam, I told you: I don't need you anymore!","probably",58
"SADDAM","You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.","probably",58
"SATAN","Yes I can! Raaarrr","probably",58
"SADDAM","Aw, you little -prick!","probably",58
"SATAN","Good-bye forever, Saddam!","probably",58
"SADDAM","What are you talking about?! You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.","probably",58
"SATAN","Not this time! I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in!","probably",58
"SADDAM","Let me in where?","probably",58
"SADDAM","What the? Hey, what the hell is this place?!","probably",58
"KYLE","Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!","4th-grade",59

"YOUNGER BOY","Thi-ird","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Stupid third grader!","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","Yeah,  get out of here!","4th-grade",59
"YOUNGER BOY","Uhuhuhow.","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","There, that's better.","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Denver?","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her.","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship!","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody! We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical!","4th-grade",59
"CLYDE","Like what?","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, ""KISS MY ASS!!!"" all together!","4th-grade",59
"THE KIDS","YEAH!!!","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","Why, that's PERfect!","4th-grade",59
"BUTTERS","Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?","4th-grade",59
"STAN","...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.","4th-grade",59
"BUTTERS","Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, ""KISS MY ASS!!!""","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","Together we are strong!","4th-grade",59
"THE KIDS","YEAH!!!","4th-grade",59

"STAN","It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.","4th-grade",59

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Why?! Where did he go?!","4th-grade",59
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","We... don't like to talk about it.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the hghest expectations for them. And with  God as my witness-","4th-grade",59
"THE ADULTS","Aww Oooo","4th-grade",59

"STAN","No??","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","No??","4th-grade",59
"STAN","So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?","4th-grade",59
"THE NERDS","Yup.","4th-grade",59
"STAN","My God!","4th-grade",59
"ANCHOR TOM","It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Over here, over here!","4th-grade",59
"ANCHOR TOM","The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.","4th-grade",59
"TIMMY","Timmi-hih-ih!","4th-grade",59
"SWAT HANSEN","Closer!  Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still!","4th-grade",59

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Whattaya think? Too forward?","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","I HAVE HAD IT!!!","4th-grade",59
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Waaah!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison!","4th-grade",59
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","As we said before, that's impossible.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","What in God's name happened to him?","4th-grade",59
"CHEF","Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.","4th-grade",59
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.","4th-grade",59
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.","4th-grade",59
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","He finaly snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.","4th-grade",59
"CHEF","Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', ""I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!""","4th-grade",59
"MR. GARRISON","Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","And, nobody has found him?","4th-grade",59
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well, we really haven't ll-looked.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","I see.  Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!","4th-grade",59
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up  and up  and up!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","What?","4th-grade",59
"BRUNETTE","Oh my God, Oh my God!","4th-grade",59

"TIMMY","Ah, please help!","4th-grade",59
"TIMMY","Please help.","4th-grade",59

"MR. GARRISON","Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Choksondik.","4th-grade",59
"MR. GARRISON","No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Mr. Garrison, these children are depeding on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!","4th-grade",59

"MR. GARRISON","NOOO!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","No??","4th-grade",59
"MR. GARRISON","Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extingish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them.""","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Oh.","4th-grade",59
"MR. GARRISON","Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Pre-sent them?","4th-grade",59
"MR. GARRISON","Good.  Very good.  You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.","4th-grade",59

"CARTMAN","Who the hell cares?!","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!","4th-grade",59

"MR. GARRISON","Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?","4th-grade",59

"CLEAN GARRISON","I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.","4th-grade",59
"UNKEMPT GARRISON","Why?","4th-grade",59
"CLEAN GARRISON","Don't you see?  All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. Of who... we are.","4th-grade",59
"UNKEMPT GARRISON","But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!","4th-grade",59
"CLEAN GARRISON","Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!","4th-grade",59
"UNKEMPT GARRISON","I was just comparing size!","4th-grade",59
"CLEAN GARRISON","For seven minutes?!","4th-grade",59

"CARTMAN","Touchü¾Ž–”¼, teacher. Touchü¾Ž–”¼.","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?","4th-grade",59
"STAN","Dude. Sh-she's right.","4th-grade",59
"KYLE","Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.","4th-grade",59

"KYLE","Yeah! You suck, Cartman!","4th-grade",59
"CARTMAN","What??","4th-grade",59
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade.","4th-grade",59

"MR. GARRISON","Okay, children, let's take our seats. My name is Mr. Garrison. And I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of  ""rat carcasses""  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me g n teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with role call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?","trapper-keeper",60
"FILMORE","Heoh.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Sally Bands?","trapper-keeper",60
"SALLY","Here.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Alright, Ike Broflovski.","trapper-keeper",60
"IKE","Cookah Monster.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Broflovski --- I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically.  I can take something as simple as this calculator and... Trapper Keeper?","trapper-keeper",60
"TRAPPER KEEPER","Trapper Keeper active.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Hybrid with Wellington Bear Calculator.","trapper-keeper",60
"TRAPPER KEEPER","Ready for hybrid.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","And now it can use Wellington Bear Calculator, too.","trapper-keeper",60
"KIDS","Wow.","trapper-keeper",60
"BILL","May I hold your Trapper Keeper?","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers.  If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","I'm gonna!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Hold it.","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","I will!","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Aaand that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.

"MR. GARRISON","Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.","trapper-keeper",60
"JENNY","I gotta go doodie.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class presdient?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.","trapper-keeper",60
"IKE","No.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, our second nominee is Ike The Genius.  Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?","trapper-keeper",60
"FILMORE","If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you.","trapper-keeper",60

"CARTMAN","I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.","trapper-keeper",60
"BILL","Please. We can have fun and play games, like humon four square  I mean, four square.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend, It doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Okay, that's cool.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Ah- alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some- .","trapper-keeper",60

"FLORA","I don't know...","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Flora, you have to pick one: Filmore or Ike.","trapper-keeper",60
"FLORA","Um, I vote for... I don't know.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.","trapper-keeper",60
"FLORA","Okay.","trapper-keeper",60

"CARTMAN","Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.","trapper-keeper",60
"BILL","That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?","trapper-keeper",60
"BARBRADY","Bill Cosby??","trapper-keeper",60
"BILL","Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby.  My name is VSM471. I am a cyborg engineered by humons from the year 2034.","trapper-keeper",60
"BARBRADY","Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Wow, that's amazing","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","What do you think, Officer Barbrady?","trapper-keeper",60
"BARBRADY","Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","...You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Yes!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes!","trapper-keeper",60
"FLORA","I decided.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?","trapper-keeper",60
"FLORA","Uumm, Ike.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class persident.","trapper-keeper",60
"FILMORE","We want a recount.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","What?","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You LOST, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike!","trapper-keeper",60
"FILMORE","Count them again.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","NO, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. IT'S OVER! IKE IS CLASS PRESIDENT!","trapper-keeper",60
"FILLMORE","Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote.","trapper-keeper",60

"MR. GARRISON","Jesus! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote! Now go home!","trapper-keeper",60

"CARTMAN","Hey, dudes.","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a NEW one!  So everything worked out.","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Why the hell not?!","trapper-keeper",60
"STAN","Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was THIS Trapper Keeper and not the one before!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Wait... sso then you guys burned my last one for no reason!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.","trapper-keeper",60
"KYLE","Don't you get it?! You can't have ANY Trapper Keeper, fatass!","trapper-keeper",60
"CARTMAN","Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think?! I think this whole thing is a SETUP! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else?! Screw you guys, I'm going home!","trapper-keeper",60

"MR. GARRISON","There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?!","trapper-keeper",60

"MR. GARRISON","Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment!! WELL, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON TV DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW CRAP ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT!!! NOW GET YOUR ASS BACK ON FIRST CLASS AND RESPECT THIS CLASS'S RIGHT TO MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS!!!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.","trapper-keeper",60

"MR. GARRISON","Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regardng Form 22F. Do we all have that form?","trapper-keeper",60

"JESSE JACKSON","That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!","trapper-keeper",60
"MR. GARRISON","We don't have any African-Americans in our class!","trapper-keeper",60
"JESSE JACKSON","Oh. Bye.","trapper-keeper",60

"CARTMAN","Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"STAN","'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"KYLE","Can we take a lunch break now?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"CARTMAN","No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!","helen-keller,-the-musical",61

"KYLE","Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"CARRTMAN","Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"CLYDE","Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"WENDY","I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"TOKEN","Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61

"CARTMAN","Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"KYLE","I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"CARTMAN","You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"KYLE","Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61

"TIMMY","Gobbles?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"LAMOND","You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61

"LAMOND","They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and falyed while thery're still alive.

"CARTMAN","Like what?","helen-keller,-the-musical",61
"JEFFREY","Let's see.  Helen Keller was blind and deaf.  Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here.","helen-keller,-the-musical",61

"A BRITISH PERSON","Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day.  Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely??  But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. Your very own metal fuzzy dice.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Yes. I see.  Hoh, lovely.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Joe, do you know anything about girls?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","But, do you anything about them? About how they work.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. Who could that be?","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","Joe, the blacksmith?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","The same.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I'm Pip, sir.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. Do you still object?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","That's great news!","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oho. But it must be Ms. Havesham!","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Yes sir.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","Then you will go to London in a week's time.  Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","I am, sir.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","Then I should take my leave.  Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Good-bye, sir.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Pip!  A young gentleman! Of great expectations!","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","None, sir.","great-expectations",62
"LAWYER","I should think not.  On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.","great-expectations",62
"A BOY","Mr. Pip?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Mr. Pocket?","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Pray, come in!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth.  This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","My, how lovely.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them!  I'm quite ashamed!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oh it's... quite alright.  Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havesham's house!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havesham is very generous indeed.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Well, what do you mean?","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Well, don't you know about Ms. Havesham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come!  Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havesham.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havesham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat.  And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure.  Anyway, Ms. Havesham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip , to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Sorry! Sorry!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure.  So this man pursued Ms. Havesham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom.  And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oh. Excuse me.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havesham received 20 minutes before the wedding.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Terribly sorry, Pocket,","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Not at all, I'm sure!","great-expectations",62
"A BRITISH PERSON","And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havesham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Good evening, Ms. Havesham.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Come closer, Pip.  My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Thanks to you.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well.  She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oh, my! She is even prettier than before.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Righto.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Yes, but... where will I find her?","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Thank you, Ms. Havesham! For everything! I'm the happiest boy in the land!","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. Lover her.","great-expectations",62
"A BRITISH PERSON","Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Hello, Estella.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Pip.  My goodness, how you've changed!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I?","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","I suppose.  So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Naturally.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Is it? Why?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Because I believe I'm in love with you.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Pip, you must know that I have no heart.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I think you do.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but  you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.","great-expectations",62
"OLDER BOY","Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Alright, Steve. Just one moment.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Who...? Who is that?","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","I should. He's my boyfriend.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Boyfriend??","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","What's the matter, Pip?!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip.  He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very  I'm  leaving.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Ms. Havesham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a-","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Ms. Havesham! But um...","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? Look at the way he holds her hand.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","But I don't understand.  You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estalla.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Yes. Tell me about the pain.  Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","It's... a-as if... sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss  squeezing it very tightly.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.","great-expectations",62
"STEVE","Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","But why do you make your daughter hurt people?","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device.  You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.","great-expectations",62
"STEVE","What the hell??","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform.","great-expectations",62
"STEVE","Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! What the?!","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you!","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Pip? Pip, old chap?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Joe?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","That's right. You're safe and warm now.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Ms Havesham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house!  Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","You? But why?","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havesham. She totally let me believe it.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman.who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Righto. Pip. Righto.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","What's that, Pip.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","If Ms. Havesham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Yeah!","great-expectations",62
"A BRITISH PERSON","And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, inwhich the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havesham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Yes, Mother.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Pip?","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havesham!","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Dear God, Pip, look!","great-expectations",62
"STEVE","Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!","great-expectations",62
"BOY","So am I.","great-expectations",62
"MAN","And me.","great-expectations",62
"MAN IN MIDDLE","We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Yes. Cry away, males.  Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","You won't get away with this!","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","Won't I?  Let the transformation begin.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Pip, she started the device!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Righto, Pip.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","It begins.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","It is... what I was raised for.","great-expectations",62
"ROBOT MONEKY","AAAAAAA!!!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havesham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.","great-expectations",62
"MAN","How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Yes, but just thnk about... panda bears! Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are.  What silly little noses they have!","great-expectations",62
"MAN","Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive.","great-expectations",62
"MS. HAVESHAM","...Yes...","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","I told you, Pip. I have no heart","great-expectations",62
"PIP","But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all!  Look at this adorable little bunny.","great-expectations",62
"ESTELLA","Oh my. 'E's very cute.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck.  ...Oh. But look at this bunny.  There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies.  ...Right.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.","great-expectations",62
"MAN","My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about...","great-expectations",62
"MAN IN MIDDLE","Ice-skating!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Oh what fun ice-skating is!  Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.","great-expectations",62
"JOE","Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!","great-expectations",62
"PIP","Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- Ten baby bunnies!","great-expectations",62
"JOE","...There's too many of them!","great-expectations",62
"POCKET","Please, sirs, you must not cry!","great-expectations",62

"ESTELLA","I don't want to kill any more of them.","great-expectations",62
"PIP","There! You see?! You do have a heart!","great-expectations",62

"SUSAN","Thre is no escape.","fat-camp",63
"RICK","So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT","fat-camp",63

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Congratulations. How do you feel?","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","I feel awesome!","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm  a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy!  Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.","fat-camp",63
"LIANE","I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?","fat-camp",63
"CARTMAN","Memememeee!","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Did you like the old one?","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","Good point.","fat-camp",63
"ANNOUNCER","And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access.","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman!  Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny?","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.","fat-camp",63
"KENNY","(Sure!)","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","This is ridiculous!","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?","fat-camp",63
"STAN","We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","I can't say I approve of this, my children.","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","Huh? Why not?","fat-camp",63
"JESUS","Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.","fat-camp",63
"STAN","What's a prostitute?","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","I don't know.","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Hello there, children!","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Chef, what's a prostitute?","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questons that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rim jub, Chef?""  For once, can't just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","It sure is! Thank you.","fat-camp",63

"CHEF","Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","Lunchtime! I'm starved!","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Oh my God. Eric?","fat-camp",63
"NEW CARTMAN","That's me.","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Chef was just about to tell us what a protitute is.","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Why do you need to know what a prostitue is anyway?!","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?","fat-camp",63
"KENNY","(Yeah. Am I?)","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.","fat-camp",63
"KYLE","Why?","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.","fat-camp",63
"STAN","Like what?","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","Like keeping you company. Understand?","fat-camp",63
"STAN","No.","fat-camp",63
"CHEF","You see, chidren, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk.","fat-camp",63
"JAMES TAYLOR"," JAMES TAYLOR","fat-camp",63

"KYLE","We I wish I didn't have any parents!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","How?!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","The police?","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","What's that?","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","Wow! Three months without parents!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64

"KYLE","Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","""My parents molestered me.""","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","No, but you've gotta cry, like this: ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say somethng like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Ih, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","What's ""bad touch""?","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","Okay, molestered, bad touch.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CARTMAN","Yeah, And cry.  Oh, he's ready.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CASE WORKER","You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CASE WORKER","Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CASE WORKER","They'll never be able to hurt you again.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KYLE","Cool, thanks.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"CASE WORKER","Alright, folks. Our work here is done.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64

"BOY","The story of the Before time.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birthgivers' laws. But the birthgivers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Yuck, yuck, yuck.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birthgivers disappear. , by using the magic M word.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Provider. Provider.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Boo!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"BOY","Bwack bwack!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Coosh!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","Carousel, Carousel.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"MARK","Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"STAN","Yes. No foolies.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"KIDS","No foolies.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"MARK","No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on.  Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"LINDA","Mark, I'm scared.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64

Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with vwhat you lust after most.  Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"MR. EVANS","Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"MR. EVANS","I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down!  Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done!

"STAN","Parents?","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64
"MARK","The birth-givers! Your birthgivers. Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much.  Your birthgivers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this!  He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.","the-wacky-molestation-adventure",64

"ANCHOR TOM","Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama , broke new ground by saying ""SHIT"" on television, making ""shit"" officially okay to say around the country. A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit.  In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. Rick Watts has the story.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"KYLE","This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CARTMAN","Huh?","it-hits-the-fan",66
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance,  ""That's a shitty picture of me."" is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of  ""This is a picture of shit."" is still naughty.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CARTMAN","I don't get it.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"STAN","Me neither.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example:  ""The weather outside is shitty."" However, the literal adjective is NOT appropriate.

"CHEF","LaToya Jackson, children.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"THE BOYS","Oh.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CHEF","But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CHEF","It says here the word, ""shit"" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, ""skite.""","it-hits-the-fan",66
"KYLE","Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"STAN","Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"CARTMAN","You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This... could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"CHEF","But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"BARKER","Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"MR. GARRISON","Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!","it-hits-the-fan",66
"SORCERER","The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God...","it-hits-the-fan",66
"STAN","Look, there's the F-word.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"KYLE","And asshole.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CARTMAN","I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!","it-hits-the-fan",66
"SORCERER","Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil geldon , who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"BLOND KNIGHT","We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices!","it-hits-the-fan",66
"BLAD KNIGHT","We command you to stop saying the curse word!","it-hits-the-fan",66

"KYLE","It's okay. The curse has been lifted.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"STAN","Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"KYLE","You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"KYLE","We're all saying the S-word too much!","it-hits-the-fan",66
"IKE","Kyle.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"KYLE","The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"STAN","And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"CARTMAN","So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"THE MEN","Yeah.","it-hits-the-fan",66
"RANDY","That makes sense.","it-hits-the-fan",66

"STAN","It's gonna suck. There's gonna be all like, new kids there we don't know.","cripple-fight!",67
"KENNY","(Yeah.)","cripple-fight!",67
"STUART","Well, now, that's part of the fun!","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad.","cripple-fight!",67
"CARTMAN","That's not funny! Jesus Christ!","cripple-fight!",67

"STUART","You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Hellooo scouts.","cripple-fight!",67

"RANDY","You're the new scout leader?","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","I just got transferred in.  I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do!","cripple-fight!",67
"BOYS","Hooray!","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","See ya, Dad!","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses.  Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy!","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","Oo-well hello everyoneh.","cripple-fight!",67
"TIMMY","Jim- Jim-mih?","cripple-fight!",67
"STUART","Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","Well he got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.","cripple-fight!",67
"MAN","Well how gay is he?","cripple-fight!",67
"STUART","He's really, really gay.","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","So he's a homosexual. So what?","cripple-fight!",67
"STUART","I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??","cripple-fight!",67
"SKEETER","You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all femmit, prancin' around like girls.","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","Aw, that's ridiculous.","cripple-fight!",67
"PRIEST MAXI","People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back.","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: motivational standup comedy.  Let's give him a big hand.","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. Mm-my mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. You guys like imp-personations?","cripple-fight!",67
"TIMMY","Timmy.","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Uh Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!""","cripple-fight!",67

"RANDY","Come on, Stanley.","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck.","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","Hey, I have a great idea. Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?","cripple-fight!",67

"STAN","Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number four seven. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy!","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush.""","cripple-fight!",67
"SHARON","What a brave little boy.","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  Hhh-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my mud pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!""","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","Heheh.","cripple-fight!",67
"CARTMAN","I don't sound like that.","cripple-fight!",67

"BIG GAY AL","Hiya fellas!","cripple-fight!",67
"HEAD SCOUTMASTER","How are you today, Scout?","cripple-fight!",67

"TIMMY","Lah-livin' a lie!","cripple-fight!",67
"REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people all over the country are taking media notice.","cripple-fight!",67
"FARMER","Those boys have shown me the light. Uh I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.","cripple-fight!",67
"JOE","This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.","cripple-fight!",67
"STEVEN SPIELBERG","I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!","cripple-fight!",67
"REPORTER","The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.","cripple-fight!",67
"GLORIA ALLRED","It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate.  I am taking this case on, personally!","cripple-fight!",67
"REPORTER","With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.","cripple-fight!",67
"TOM","Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist.  This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.","cripple-fight!",67
"TOM","Here's one. And here's another.","cripple-fight!",67
"STUART","Kenny?","cripple-fight!",67

"CHIEF JUSTICE","In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!","cripple-fight!",67
"CROWD","Alright! Yeah! Woohoo!","cripple-fight!",67
"RANDY","Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.","cripple-fight!",67
"CROWD","Yeah!","cripple-fight!",67
"CHIEF JUSTICE","And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!","cripple-fight!",67
"CROWD","Hooray, yeah, yeahah!","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","We did it! We did it!","cripple-fight!",67
"GLROIA ALLRED","I did it! I did it! Haha!","cripple-fight!",67
"GLORIA ALLRED","Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are.  And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys  five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al.","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Thank you all very much. But I don't want this.","cripple-fight!",67
"CROWD MEMBERS","What's he saying?","cripple-fight!",67
"STAN","Huh?","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Look, I appreciate what you kids did; really, I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club.","cripple-fight!",67
"MAN","Uh, uh, HOORAY!","cripple-fight!",67
"ANOTHER MAN","Hooray, hey!","cripple-fight!",67

"CARTMAN","Eh, we kick ass.","cripple-fight!",67
"BIG GAY AL","Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream!","cripple-fight!",67
"GLORIA ALLRED","You can't do this! You homophobe!","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.","cripple-fight!",67
"TIMMY","Timmih.","cripple-fight!",67
"JIMMY","I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts.","cripple-fight!",67

"STAN","His a-miracles?","the-super-best-friends",68
"STEVEN","Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.","the-super-best-friends",68
"CARTMAN","When are we gonna learn magic tricks?","the-super-best-friends",68
"STAN","Yeah!","the-super-best-friends",68
"STEVEN","Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?","the-super-best-friends",68

"STEVEN","...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-","the-super-best-friends",68
"BUTTERS","And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?","the-super-best-friends",68
"STEVEN","Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? You're not really happy.","the-super-best-friends",68
"KYLE","I'm not really happy.","the-super-best-friends",68
"STEVEN","Your potential hasn't even been reached.","the-super-best-friends",68

"KYLE","That's right.","the-super-best-friends",68
"ELDERLY WOMAN","So you're not a cult?","the-super-best-friends",68

"JESUS","You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.","the-super-best-friends",68
"STAN","I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.","the-super-best-friends",68
"JESUS","The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.","the-super-best-friends",68
"STAN","Can you do it agian?","the-super-best-friends",68
"JESUS","Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. Er, nuh, tur- turn around.  Uh, okay now, turn back.  It is now wine!","the-super-best-friends",68

"CARTMAN","What?","the-super-best-friends",68
"KYLE","I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.","the-super-best-friends",68
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either.  I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.","the-super-best-friends",68
"KYLE","I thnk we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.","the-super-best-friends",68
"CARTMAN","That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.","the-super-best-friends",68

"STEVEN","Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around.  It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool!  However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such.","the-super-best-friends",68

But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.","the-super-best-friends",68

"SCOTT","Uh uh, I don't take returns!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think soho!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"CARTMAN","Noooooooooo! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CLYDE","Who's Scott Tenorman?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KIDS","Yeah.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"BUTTERS","Wuh what are you gonna do?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Did you guys see that movie Hannibal? Where the deformed guy trained giants pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony , we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's weiner.  It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his weiner bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","What's in it for us?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","What?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Oh, right. Why should we care?  Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll naver take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!""  Now who's with me?!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"TIMMY","Timmay!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"TIMMY","Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the weiner. Bite it. Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the weiner! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Eric! Are you training that pony to plese you?!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","He said it was okay.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Alright, then.  Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Not like that, pony!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Whattayou mean?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: exploit that weakness.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","How do I do that?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","What do you see?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goaddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Oo what's a Radiohead?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"NED","Mmuh what am I doing here?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Nice thinking, young hunter.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Whoa!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","What?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","What?! Give me those!  Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"NED","Mn let me see.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Radiohead. Yes, of course.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"NED","Let me see. Let me see.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Here you go.  Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"NED","Kinda.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Well, stop it!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"MR. TENORMAN","Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Oh crap!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"MR. TENORMAN","Who's out there?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JIMBO","Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"NED","I can't.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"MR. TENORMAN","Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"A MAN","Whoa, I gotta get out of here!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Uh huh.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. Everyone's gonna be there!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","You're welcome, Scott.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KURT LODER","Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now.  Guys, when is the next album coming out?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid.  Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too.  I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KURT LODER","And will there be a new tour?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! What a retard!  And now everyone saw it!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Oh my God, he killed Kenny.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!!  Then... that...  Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","Okay, Cartman, what do you want?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Got what all figured out?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","How to get Scott Tenorman back!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","Oh, Jesus!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","I just finished planning a brilliant li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","Okay, so what's the plan?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Yeah.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","So, I realized, ""What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?"" right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman ü¾³¤¼ and ü¾³¤¼ see him get his weiner bitten off by a pony!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","...What?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's weiner in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","You're such a dumbass, Cartman.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it! Yes!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"JOHNNY","Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"THOM","Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"PHIL","Wow, we have to go.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"ED","To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"THOM","Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Hello?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","Scott Tenorman?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","What do you want?!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your weiner bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"KYLE","'Cause, we're his friends.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Thennn why are you telling me?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"KYLE","'Cause we hate him.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Oh.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"MOM","Oh dear.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"MOM","Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"MOM","Let's go, hon.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"DAD","Let's.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Awesome!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"SCOTT","Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first.  Goddamnit!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Alright.  Hey, this is great!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Eh, it's a special recipe","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Gawh, this is really good, Scott!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","What?!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's.  It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap.  I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your weiner. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do somethng to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your weiner bitten off. You would most likely send your parents.  And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"MR. DENKINS","Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","My... mom and dad are... dead?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","Oh my God!  Oh my God!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"CARTMAN","Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Jesus Christ, dude!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"SCOTT","My mom and dad are dead!  No! NOOO!!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"THOM","Uhm, excuse me?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"STAN","Who are you?","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"ED","Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"COLIN","Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"THOM","You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"ED","Come om, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69
"THOM","Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.","scott-tenorman-must-die",69

"PHILLIP","Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Sure. You go the same way  except stick your finger up your ass.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Alright, no problem, buddy.  Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Because I had an itch up my ass.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Because I had an itch up my ass.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Terrance & Phillip will be right back...","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"OLDER NAN","And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Well yeah, dude.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans.  You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","No, dude, we really, really do.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"OLDER MAN","Very well, kids, we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"THE BOYS","All right!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"ANNOUNCER","Ladies and gentlemen!  Put your hands together for... Terrance!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"STAN","Yeah, he looks terrible.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good?  Uh oh.  Hey, do you all remember this one?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Uuuuhh.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"AUDIENCE","Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Hello Phillip.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Phillip? That's not Phillip.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","I think this new guy's funny.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","He sure did.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Who.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Who!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Who passed gas!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","That's the man's name?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Yes!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Right, the guy that drank his own urine.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottm of this.  'Scuse us.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOUNCER","Where do you think you're going?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","We have to talk to Terrance.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOUNCER","Hyeah, right.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOUNCER","Then get in the ""Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club"" line.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Aw, dude, gay!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","You don't understand: we saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOUNCER","You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Racist!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Man, this sucks!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOY IN GLASSES","Are you guys official presidents, too?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Don't talk to us, kid.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Kenny's a random slut.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Mmm. Mmm, yummy.  Mmm.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"GROUPIE","It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","We sure did, baby.  Next?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","You're a huge fan alright!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","Can I just have you sign my breasts?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","But what do I get in return?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","Whatever you want.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Oh yeah.  Oh, that's good, baby.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","Oh, Terrance, I love you.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","You like that?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","I love you!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Yeah.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","I LOVE you!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Ah good.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","I LOVE YOIU!!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Yeah-","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"BOTH","OH!!!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OBESE WOMAN","What the hell?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Oh wow! We had quadruplets!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids.  What do you want, an autograph or something?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","But where's Phillip?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Who?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Phillip, your partner.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, ""Hey, where's Phillip?"" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","But the guy who replaced him sucks!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Ah, I know.  I know he sucks  To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Becuase, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Ogh, whatever.  The point is, Phillip and I are through.  And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do  ""more serious"" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KENNY","(Toronto?)","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"TERRANCE","Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CLYDE","Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","That's not true.  Global warming is going to kill us all.  The Republicans are responsible.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CLYDE","Thank you.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Oh no, dude.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Uuuh, we didn't get them.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","Youuu what?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","They're not together anymore, dude.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"YOUNGER MAN","You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be perfoming with this other guy.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"OLDER MAN","Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements.  Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Weak.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Ahhh","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"LAERTES","Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","How does the queen?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KING CLAUDIUS","Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"QUEEN GERTRUDE","No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"I CAN NO MORE","the king, the king's to blame.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","The point!--envenom'd too!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"ALL","Treason! treason!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KING CLAUDIUS","O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"LAERTES","He is served;","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"STAN","Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HAMLET","...he has my dying voice;","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"HORATIO","Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Phillip! Phillip!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Yes?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","But we need you!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long?","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"CARTMAN","Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"PHILLIP","Yeah, whatever, kid.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"STAN","He'll do it, dude.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70
"KYLE","Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip.  Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were oin the cover of every magazine.  And then in 1998, even a saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip.  Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.","terrance-&-phillip,-behind-the-blow",70

"NARRATOR","The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998,  the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called ""Not Without My Anus.""  It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more pupolar show, the John Schneider Variety Hour , was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie , they were enraged, bewildered, and scared.  The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others.  The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wod pulp  Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars.

It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer.  And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 , in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was conisdered a great success.  After almost being executed by the Aemrican government , Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada , where they were touted as heroes.  They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through.

"MR. FOON","You... you're not?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","No no no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but... All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass. So then there's lines for FastPass. You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.","cartmanland",71

I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but-","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come tu us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, ""You know, I learned something today..."" and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense!  What is your logic?!  Ow.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.","cartmanland",71

"STAN","Heh, heh.  Sorry.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Hunh, I guess you're right.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides , six roller coasters , and tons of great surprises!  And the best part is:  You can't come!!  That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister , a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow!  It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!!  So come on down to Cartmanland now!  But don't plan on getting past the parking lot,  'cause remember: So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come!  Especially you, Stan and Kyle.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","That does it, dude!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Where are we going?","cartmanland",71
"STAN","We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh. Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","What the hell?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Hohohooho! Oowwww!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","You sons of bitches!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Come on, dude!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","What the hell are you doing?!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Aw, crap.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Oho God, get me off of here!!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Dude!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Stahan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Alright, let's go.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","That's right! You stay out!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fastass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","My life can't get any worse!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","You'll see! We'll get in!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","So what does does this job pay?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","I'm not interested.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","If you need security, I need a cash salary.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Ugh. Two people?","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","I will shoot on sight.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Sweet.","cartmanland",71
"DOCTOR","You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Sucky.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Dude, are you okay?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I wa thinking we could put on disguises and get in.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Jesus.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God!. Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Alrightalright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day.","cartmanland",71
"KIDS","Aw.","cartmanland",71
"BOY","That's gay.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.","cartmanland",71
"BUTTERS","Hoh.","cartmanland",71
"CLYDE","Oh.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","The rest of you will just have to try another day.","cartmanland",71
"KIDS","Aw.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.","cartmanland",71
"BUTTERS","Hoh boy, oh boy!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?","cartmanland",71
"BUTTERS","We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now?","cartmanland",71
"BUTTERS","Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house.","cartmanland",71
"CLYDE","Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Ugh, alrightalright, hang on.  Security!","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","What?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","But I don't know how it works.","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Ogh, alrightalright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go.","cartmanland",71
"TIMMY","Timmay!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Wait a minute! Who are you?","cartmanland",71
"BOY","Mike Gainor.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Get him out of here!","cartmanland",71
"SECURITY GUARD","Move along, sir.","cartmanland",71
"STAN","AAAH!  This isn't over, Cartman!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAAaaaa....","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Ah!  Aaah!","cartmanland",71
"NURSE","Just a little more  There we go.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Awesome.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Satan talked to God?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","And that's it? That's the end?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today!","cartmanland",71
"CLERK","Welcome to Cartmanland.","cartmanland",71
"DOCTOR","I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run.","cartmanland",71
"ANNOUNCER","And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.","cartmanland",71
"WAITRESS","I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.","cartmanland",71
"CLERK","No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.","cartmanland",71
"ASSOCIATE","Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Oh. Oohh.Ohuhughughhh.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me!","cartmanland",71
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!)","cartmanland",71

"MR. FOON","My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!","cartmanland",71
"CHRIS","He sure did!","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Hey, there you are!","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Just give me my money back.","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","What?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","...But it's doing great!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","You call this great?! I call it Hell! Trade me back, Goddamnit!","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","You bet! I'll go get your money right now!","cartmanland",71
"BOY","Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","GODDAMNIT GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!","cartmanland",71
"DOCTOR","I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life.","cartmanland",71
"DOCTOR","There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass!","cartmanland",71
"AGENT","Excuse me? Eric Cartman?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Yeah?","cartmanland",71
"AGENT","I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy.  Seize the assets.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","He- Hey, that's my money!","cartmanland",71
"MR. GARRETT","There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!","cartmanland",71
"MR. GARRETT","You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","Yeh- You can't take my money, Goddamnit!","cartmanland",71
"MR. GARRETT","We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Foon, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","Nohoho way, Josü¾Ž–”¼!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park I lose everything!","cartmanland",71
"MR. FOON","""I don't care,"" said Pierre. ""I'm from France.""","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","This can't be happening! AAAAAHH!!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Kyle, you gotta see!!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?","cartmanland",71
"DOCTOR","Well, I sssuppsed it could be rigged, but I-","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Then damnit man, do it!","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","It isn't fair!  You Goddamned assholes, it isn't fair!","cartmanland",71
"STAN","Look, Kyle. Look.","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Huh?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?!","cartmanland",71
"KYLE","Huh?","cartmanland",71
"CARTMAN","I'M SO PISSED OFF!","cartmanland",71

"STAN","Oh no, what now?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on!","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","What's this all about, Kenny?","proper-condom-use",72
"KENNY","(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket. Come on.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","No they don't!","proper-condom-use",72
"KENNY","(Yeah they do!)","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Whoa, cool!","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","That's awesome!","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","I told you guys.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","You ""beat off?""","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it-hey come here, dog. Dog, come here!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","But it's super-cool!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Later, sweetie.  Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.","proper-condom-use",72
"MAN","Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: ""Cannery Row in Monterey in California-"" ""-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..."" It's amazing how with three images he puts you right there, and...","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Red rocket, red rocket!","proper-condom-use",72
"RANDY","WAAAH!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket.","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","My room? Why?","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Go, Stanley!  Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","No!","proper-condom-use",72
"RANDY","Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Why?! What's the big deal?!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out.","proper-condom-use",72
"RANDY","No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Huh??","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!","proper-condom-use",72
"RANDY","Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","What things??","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","No!","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!","proper-condom-use",72
"RANDY","Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone!","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. TWEEK","It isn't soon enough.","proper-condom-use",72
"STUART","Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog.","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.","proper-condom-use",72
"ADULTS","Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like ""penis"" and ""vagina."" Nuh now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay.  Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum.  STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral!  M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... let's see: the the man takes his penis, and he... hm.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh what the hell did I do with that damned thing??","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.","proper-condom-use",72
"WENDY","Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.","proper-condom-use",72
"BEBE","Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRLS","Yeah!","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we?  SEXUALLY TRANSMITTTED DISEASES!! That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?","proper-condom-use",72
"WENDY","I didn't mean that-","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, ""It's not going to happen to me."" You say, ""Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado."" WRONG!  Gonorrhea, herpes, clamydia, HPV, HIV, syphillis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences!  You think that sex is about fun and games and love?  Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRLS","AAAHHH!","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","And here's a little syphillis for you!","proper-condom-use",72

"CHEF","How is sexual education class going?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.","proper-condom-use",72

"CHEF","...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.","proper-condom-use",72

"BUTTERS","Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Is that what you learned in sex ed?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.","proper-condom-use",72
"WENDY","You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","But Wendy, we don't understand how thatt-","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRLS","AAAAHHH!","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Oh my God, dude.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Uh what are we gonna do, huh?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.","proper-condom-use",72
"BOYS","Yeah.","proper-condom-use",72
"PHARMACIST","Can I help you boys?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Yeah, we need condoms!","proper-condom-use",72
"PHARMACIST","Condoms.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Yeah. Quick!","proper-condom-use",72
"PHARMACIST","How old are you boys?","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Why does that matter?","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Ha-I'll be nine next week.","proper-condom-use",72
"PHARMACIST","Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?","proper-condom-use",72
"PHARMACIST","I just don't think kids your age should be-","proper-condom-use",72
"ASSISTANT","Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them.","proper-condom-use",72
"MARK","But... they're... children!","proper-condom-use",72
"ASSISTANT","Would you rather them do it unprotected?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!","proper-condom-use",72
"MARK","I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!","proper-condom-use",72
"ASSISTANT","Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.","proper-condom-use",72
"MARK","I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!","proper-condom-use",72
"ASSISTANT","Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?","proper-condom-use",72
"ASSISTANT","No, you have to change it.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... ""missed"" anything.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yeah, why d-uh, did you?","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Did I what?","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin.  But I'm not ashamed of it!  I wasn't sought after much in high school or college.  I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses.  The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Superbowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Your nickname?","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","""That guy with the really big head.""","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","...Right.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and fourd it possible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Neither have I.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mehean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Well, back to the lesson plan, then.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Right.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Okay.  ""Oral Sex""","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Doesn't it give any other directions?","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your weiner.  ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes""","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Uh, what are ""studzes""","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Just put it on, Butters.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Ha-a how come I gotta go first?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Sure.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","But it won't stay on. I I need a rubber band or somethin'.","proper-condom-use",72
"TWEEK","Ah I got rubber bands.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","How do you feel?","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","...Pretty good.","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Do you feel protected?","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my weiner through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.","proper-condom-use",72
"TIMMY","Timmehah!","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","...Kindergarten.","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","Kindergarten?!","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. ADLER","I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","I guess we have no choice.","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?","proper-condom-use",72
"JENNY","It flies around and it's endangered.","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. GARRISON","That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor.  Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs.  Yes, Filmore?","proper-condom-use",72
"FILMORE","Can we do fingerpaint?","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. GARRISON","NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all.  PREGNANCY!  That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?!","proper-condom-use",72
"NARRATOR","Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth.  The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRLS","Eeeeww.","proper-condom-use",72
"NARRATOR","Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born.  but Mom's not done yet.","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRL","Eeww.","proper-condom-use",72
"NARRATOR","She still got some afterbirth to push out of her.","proper-condom-use",72
"GIRLS","AAAAAAAA!!!!","proper-condom-use",72
"NARRATOR","That's right.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Girls! Girls! Where are you going?!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Man, this condom's driving me crazy.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cuase it itches so much.","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Why are you wearing a condom?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","So I don't get AIDS.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","From sex??","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes.","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","You mean, intercourse with a girl?","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside","proper-condom-use",72
"KYLE","Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","Yeah, come on guys, this is war!","proper-condom-use",72
"BOYS","Yeah! That's right! Come on!","proper-condom-use",72

"MR. GARRISON","Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.","proper-condom-use",72
"CLYDE","There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out.","proper-condom-use",72
"WENDY","Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!","proper-condom-use",72
"BEBE","Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!","proper-condom-use",72

"KYLE","Yeah! You get out of town!","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Here, talk to them, Butters.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.","proper-condom-use",72
"BUTTERS","Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.","proper-condom-use",72

"COUNSELOR MACKEY","M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","And these... are the two areas most important to-","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I go crazy.","proper-condom-use",72
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Yeah. Hmm.","proper-condom-use",72

"MR. GARRISON","Jesus Christ.","proper-condom-use",72
"CARTMAN","Ew, Butters? You're in big trouble now.","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","Well,I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves.","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to thave sex with them first.","proper-condom-use",72
"KIDS","Oooohhh.","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.","proper-condom-use",72
"PARENTS","Huh?","proper-condom-use",72
"CHEF","Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each say! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know,  someone who has a bad opinion of it,  or even a complete pervert.","proper-condom-use",72
"MR. GARRISON","Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?","proper-condom-use",72
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently","proper-condom-use",72
"SHARON","This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.","proper-condom-use",72
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.","proper-condom-use",72
"KIDS","Hooray!","proper-condom-use",72
"STAN","But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?","proper-condom-use",72

"CARTMAN","I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.","towelie",73
"SHARON","Are you guys still playing that video game?","towelie",73
"STAN","Yeah. Hay Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through.","towelie",73
"SHARON","Eric, put that down!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Why?","towelie",73
"SHARON","Just go put it back in the trashcan!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.","towelie",73
"SHARON","No that... that came from me; just put it away.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.","towelie",73

"KYLE","I don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere.","towelie",73
"STAN","Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!","towelie",73

"TOWELIE","Don't forget to bring a towel.","towelie",73
"STAN","What?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, ""Don't forget to bring a towel.""","towelie",73

"TOWELIE","Don't forget to bring a towel.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Uh no.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, ""Always keep an extra towel in your duffle bag.""","towelie",73
"STAN","Okay, we will.","towelie",73

"COMMANDER","Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at...  Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County Colorado!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","What, dude?","towelie",73
"STAN","This is gonna be one looong-ass day.","towelie",73
"STAN","That was the longest day of school ever!","towelie",73

"KYLE","Where the hell is he?","towelie",73
"KENNY","(I don't know. Where could it be?)","towelie",73
"STAN","I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.","towelie",73
"KYLE","What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. Gebaayybeh!  Gebaayybeh!","towelie",73
"KYLE","That's a towel call?","towelie",73
"STAN","This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.","towelie",73
"STAN","Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!","towelie",73

"KYLE","Are you sure this is where they said to be?","towelie",73
"STAN","They said the gas station outside of town.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Well, I'm gonna get a little high.","towelie",73
"MAN","Hold it!","towelie",73
"STAN","Who is that?","towelie",73
"MAN","Step... away... from the towel!","towelie",73
"OFFICIAL","There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.","towelie",73
"OFFICIAL","It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.","towelie",73

"KYLE","Aw, God-damnit!","towelie",73
"STAN","Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.","towelie",73
"STAN","Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Well?","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel.  They must have some unexplainable bond with it.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Yes.  Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Are we getting close?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","I think so.","towelie",73
"STAN","A little more gas, Kenny.","towelie",73
"KYLE","How long has it been since you've been back there.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","No it isn't.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Is!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","No it isn't.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.","towelie",73
"STAN","Brake, Kenny, brake.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Egh!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","M-maybe it's down that dirt road.","towelie",73
"STAN","Dude, don't you remember where it is?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high.  then I'll remember where it is.","towelie",73
"STAN","Alright, so where is it?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Where's what?","towelie",73
"BOYS","Agh!","towelie",73
"KYLE","The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is!","towelie",73
"STAN","Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Well calm down.","towelie",73
"KYLE","That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","That's my last joint, asshole!","towelie",73
"KYLE","I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.","towelie",73
"WOMAN","Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil.  Kevin, is that you?","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Harris! Reach bang and clear!","towelie",73
"WOMAN","Hello?  WAAH!  Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod!","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Alright, it's clear! It's clear!","towelie",73
"SOLDIERS","HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Let's go let'sg o!","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Get it!","towelie",73
"MR. GARRISON","What the?","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Throw it down!","towelie",73
"MR. GARRISON","Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures!","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Alright, let's go!","towelie",73
"MR. GARRISON","Huh where are you goin'?","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","This is where you came from?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Yeah, I think so.  Oh man.","towelie",73
"STAN","What?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.","towelie",73
"STAN","Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?","towelie",73
"KYLE","We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth","towelie",73
"STAN","We don't care.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.","towelie",73
"STAN","Dude, we don't care.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.","towelie",73
"STAN","We... don't... care.","towelie",73
"KYLE","All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Who's they?","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.","towelie",73
"STAN","Don't care, don't care, don't care.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at ""their"" base.","towelie",73
"STAN","Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","You mean to go right into their base? Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Sir! Sargeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Ah yes.  Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?","towelie",73
"SGT MASTERS","Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this.","towelie",73
"SGT BOLL","Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Hmm...  So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!","towelie",73
"SGT MASTERS","Oo we...","towelie",73
"SGT BOLL","He must have outsmarted us, sir.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Okay.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.","towelie",73
"STAN","We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?","towelie",73
"GUARD","Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?","towelie",73
"STAN","Yeah.","towelie",73
"GUARD","Go go go go go go!","towelie",73
"KYLE","Dude, I figured it out.","towelie",73
"STAN","What?","towelie",73
"KYLE","If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!","towelie",73
"STAN","So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?","towelie",73
"KYLE","Seven and a half.","towelie",73
"STAN","Hurry up, stupid parachute!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Let's see.  No.","towelie",73
"STAN","Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Hey it's been a long time!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Don't preach to me, fatso!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","You're stupid!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Yeah, and you're a towel!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","You're a towel!  Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.","towelie",73
"STAN","Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Hold on.  Wait a second  That's it!","towelie",73
"KYLE","That's it?","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Yeah. That's the melody to ""Funky Town."" Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.","towelie",73
"STAN","No, Towelie, the entry code!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","For what?","towelie",73
"STAN","God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Well let's look in here.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE CLONE","Kill... me... Kill... me.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Oh my God! No-o-o-o!","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","What are these things?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.","towelie",73
"TOWELIE CLONE","Kill... me.","towelie",73
"STAN","Do you have our Okama GameSphere?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.","towelie",73
"STAN","Oh God, don't care, don't care.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret.","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.","towelie",73
"KYLE","What terrifying secret?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.","towelie",73
"KYLE","And we don't care.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.","towelie",73
"STAN","So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Oh yes. It has been all along.","towelie",73
"SOLDIER","Can I kill the towel now, sir?","towelie",73
"KYLE","Go ahead.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","No, wait.  Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.","towelie",73
"STAN","But we don't care!","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.","towelie",73
"STAN","We're just going in to get our video game back.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Photon rifle, whatever.","towelie",73
"STAN","Hello? Hello, anybody here?","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move!  Don't make a move, you bastards!","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!","towelie",73
"STAN","Ohmigod, look!","towelie",73
"KYLE","Our GamdSphere!","towelie",73
"STAN","Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays.","towelie",73
"RESEARCH LEADER","You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.","towelie",73
"KYLE","Sweet!","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar!","towelie",73
"STAN","Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!","towelie",73
"ZYTAR","Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","And now you know the horrible truth, boys.","towelie",73
"ZYTAR","Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Could you turn it up?","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out!  I think I can get it from here, boys!","towelie",73
"ZYTAR","What are you doing? You'll kill us all!","towelie",73
"COMMANDER","Sorry, Zytar. Didn't yoru mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings.","towelie",73
"BOYS","Oooww!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Hup hup. Come on, hang on.","towelie",73
"KENNY","(Help help! Heeelllppp!)","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Kenny!","towelie",73
"KENNY","(Nooo!)","towelie",73
"KYLE","Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer!","towelie",73
"STAN","Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Get away from me, you evil towel!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","No way! They're my friends!","towelie",73
"KYLE","I've almost got it!","towelie",73
"STAN","Aw, crap!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","You asshole.","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both!","towelie",73
"KYLE","I got it!","towelie",73
"STAN","Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!","towelie",73
"CARTMAN","Hooray!","towelie",73
"STAN","Oh, dude, we finished level 50!","towelie",73
"KYLE","Awesome!","towelie",73
"TOWELIE","Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.","towelie",73

"BUTTERS","Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"STAN",":	Butters, what the hell are you doing?","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"BUTTERS","Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"KYLE","These are gas masks, Butters!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"STAN","Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"BUTTERS","What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74

"BUTTERS","Stop breathin'?","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"KYLE","Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"BUTTERS","Well. Alright, then.","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Well okay. Next?  Next?  Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers...  Okay, next? A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74

"OFFICER BARBRADY","I'll think of a way. Now move along!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74

"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan.  So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"CARTMAN","HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Eric, the Afghan people need our help!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74

"WENDY","We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan, and the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74
"CARTMAN","That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're jsut kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.","osama-bin-laden-has-farty-pants",74

"RECEPTIONIST","Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"STEVEN","Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"MARTHA","The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why.  We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"RECEPTIONIST","And this was back in Wisconsin?","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"STEVEN","Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west.  That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"MARTHA","We've tried every avenue to find him, but, we've never tried the milk company.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"RECEPTIONIST","Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk  is not only the best resource for finding kids,  but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75

"STEVEN","Please, please. It's not your fault.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"PRESIDENT","Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible.  That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"MARTHA","Amazing.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75

"MARTHA","That's right.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"MRS. GARTHUNK","But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"STEVEN","Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo,  we assumed someone had seen him since we did.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75
"MARTHA","This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy.","how-to-eat-with-your-butt",75

Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel.","the-entity",76
"HISPANIC REPORTER","Thanks, Tom, I-oh...  Thanks, Tom. So far Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes , Steve Jobs , Ted Turner , Donald Trump , Bill Gates , and Yasmine Bleeth . Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is ""IT""? What does ""IT""do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando , HBC News.","the-entity",76

"JADA PINKETT SMITH","Oh, Will, it's beautiful.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"WILL SMITH","Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"OLDER BOY","Ah, a local boy. You shall be our nwe playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","I'm Token.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"WILL SMITH","How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","Very well. Come, local boy.  Show us how to play your mountain games.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","All right!  Thanks, God.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77

"TOKEN","You do? God, that's great!","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"DANIEL","Why?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda  low to  middle-income.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","Why? What happened to all their money?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Well, they never really had any money.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Well I... think that.. they...","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","Indeed.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","So we must plead with him:  ""Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy.""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"DANIEL","""Please, Daddy, please!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","""Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","""I want a llama, Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","""I'd do the picture, Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","""Please, Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"FREDERICK","""Daddy, please!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"LISA","""Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"DANIEL","""But Daddy!""","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77

"ASLAN","M-I am.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Well, I'm Token","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","So, you want to live with the lions, do you?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","And what makes you think you can fit it with us?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","Well, I don't know.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","Do you like jokes?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","What?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","...I like jokes a lot.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw.  Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm!  Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho!","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","So can I stay?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"REPORTER","A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight  in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"SKEETER","If they get that petition passed, it's all over.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"JIMBO","I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"MR. GARRISON","Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"SKEETER","They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77

"TOKEN","...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","...No thanks.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"ASLAN","Go on. It's spearmint!","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77
"TOKEN","No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.","here-comes-the-neighborhood",77

"CARTMAN","Better.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(A football machine?)","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Better.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Well WHAT, Cartman?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","...What?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Mint condition, tax free.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","I'm leaving right now!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","You've never watched the news, fatass! And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Stem cells, numbnuts!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Stem cells?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(What the fuck are stem cells?)","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","...I hate you so much.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Hello. Is this theee University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're corrently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of somesah aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.","kenny-dies",78
"RECEPTIONIST","Can I help you?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyam?","kenny-dies",78
"RECEPTIONIST","Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?","kenny-dies",78
"RESEARCHER","This is awful, just awful!","kenny-dies",78
"RECEPTIONIST","Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.","kenny-dies",78
"RECEPTIONIST","A ban? Why?","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! God-damnit!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.","kenny-dies",78
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Alright, class, let's take our seats. Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","The principal? Aw, come on!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!","kenny-dies",78
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","She needs to see you now!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.","kenny-dies",78
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Hello, boys.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Wait. What's going on here?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.","kenny-dies",78
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Kenny's sick?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Well how sick?","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?","kenny-dies",78
"SHARON","Oh dear.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.","kenny-dies",78
"SHARON","Randy...","kenny-dies",78
"RANDY","They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Wait. Kenny's going to die?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","...But... he's our... fu... fufu friend.","kenny-dies",78
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.","kenny-dies",78
"LIANE","Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.","kenny-dies",78
"LIANE","They say it's an emergency.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Buh, alright.  eh Butters?","kenny-dies",78
"BUTTERS","Uhyeah?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?","kenny-dies",78
"BUTTERS","Eh just about.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.","kenny-dies",78
"BUTTERS","Oh. Well, uhokay.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.","kenny-dies",78
"BUTTERS","Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","What is this, a PTA meeting?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Cartman.  Kenny's in the hospital.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","In the ...hospital? Why?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Die? Kenny?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Yeah. Yeah, of course.","kenny-dies",78
"DOCTOR","There we go, little buddy.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(Thank you, Doc.)","kenny-dies",78
"DOCTOR","You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(I'm all right)","kenny-dies",78
"NURSE","Hey, look who has some visitors.","kenny-dies",78
"DOCTOR","Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Hey dude, how's it going?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(I'm okay, I guess.)","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Heh, sorry.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Hey, uhwe were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I-","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Stan?  Stan, where are you going?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I can't, I just can't.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Dude, he needs us right now.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","I, I know it's tough but-  Look at me! I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Just leave me alone!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Stan, you can't leave!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I'm not the one who's leaving, he is!","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)","kenny-dies",78
"HURSE","Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Dont you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Cartman?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Cartman, were you... crying?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just uh.  Oh man.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a black cell. Do you understand?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Not at all, but go on.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the mising part of the spine.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","My God...","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? Ihin other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","That's the theory.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Hmmm.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Where are you going?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Hey kid.  Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Oh, doctor.  Thanks. Thanks.","kenny-dies",78
"LARRY","Oh, hey kid.  Good luck. Good luck.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane!","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(Yes.)  (But what about Stan?)","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(I hope so)","kenny-dies",78
"NURSE","Hey, look who's here.","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(Stan??)","kenny-dies",78
"WOMAN","Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.","kenny-dies",78
"BOB","We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.","kenny-dies",78
"MS. MCCORMICK","Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)","kenny-dies",78
"LAURA","We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","Neat, huh Kenny?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(Yes.)","kenny-dies",78
"LAURA","So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be?","kenny-dies",78
"BOB","What's your wish, pal?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)","kenny-dies",78
"LAURA","What did he say?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","He said his wish is not to die.","kenny-dies",78
"LAURA","...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?","kenny-dies",78
"BOB","I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?","kenny-dies",78
"KENNY","(No. Fuckin' Madonna...)","kenny-dies",78
"BOB","Wu what was that?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself.","kenny-dies",78
"MADONNA","Should I come in now?","kenny-dies",78
"BOB","Uh no not quite yet.","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Hello there, children.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Hey Chef.","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","How's it goin'?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Bad.","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Yeah. Things have been better.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes.Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","But then, why does God give us anything to start with?","kenny-dies",78
"CHEF","Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I thnk I understand.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and... I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song","kenny-dies",78
"A FEW CONGRESSMEN","And incidents arose from circumstance?","kenny-dies",78
"EVERYONE","One thing led to another; we were young","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to compnaies like Alder Labs.","kenny-dies",78
"WOMAN","Oh, I don't know.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.","kenny-dies",78
"JILL","Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Great, just sign right here, please. Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great. Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.","kenny-dies",78
"MAN","Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.","kenny-dies",78
"HEAD NURSE","Young man, do you know where you're going?","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.","kenny-dies",78
"HEAD NURSE","All right!","kenny-dies",78
"MAN IN WHEELCHAIR","Go kid!","kenny-dies",78
"MAN ON CRUTCHES","Good for you!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. Did he say anything before he went?","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","He just said... ""Where's Stan?""","kenny-dies",78
"MR. GARRISON","And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend.","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","You guys! Come quick!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","What, Cartman","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","What, Cartman? What's happened?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Look.  I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! It worked!","kenny-dies",78
"STAN","This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?","kenny-dies",78
"CARTMAN","Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!","kenny-dies",78
"KYLE","I actually hugged you. I held you in","kenny-dies",78
"BUTTERS","Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Oh, is it soneone's anniversary soon?","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"BUTTERS","It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh but it's really nifty.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm goona get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs!","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"BUTTERS","Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHOIR","Who's the boy who can laugh at a storm cloud?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","That's me.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHOIR","Who's the boy with the eyes full of wonder?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","That's me.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHOIR","Jumpin' in puddles, skippin' down the hallway","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","I hope he means me, haha.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","I'll be back in a little bit.  Butters, you're in charge of the house.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yes sir!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short.  I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Dad's a good shopper all right.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave yuu a badge and made you an honorary inspector?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Sure I do!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing.  What do you say?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHOIR","Everyone know it's Butters!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Uh, that's me!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","""White Swallow Bath House""","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHOIR","Everyone know it's Butters!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Uh, that's me!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","I'm back, Ma!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","I sure did.  Dad sure had a nice night out.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Well first, he went to see a movie.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. I didn't know it was open.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Wait a minute. What was the movie called?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","""Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Oh my God...","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","To the gym.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","To the gym.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Gaah!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for firteen minutes straight!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures.

"BUTTERS","Well, sure thing, Dad.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Yes, it sure can be.  But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little ih, is appropriate. These are called ""little white lies.""","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Little white lies?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Ya see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","...Uh, who's Jack?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, weh, she might go completely insane.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","It won't? Oh, good.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","You... what?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"BUTTERS","Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad.  Oh boy, a drive!","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"MOM","Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","And sometimes moomies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MOM","If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? It's cold out here.","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"BUTTERS","That's me!","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"LINDA","Then why, Chris, why??!!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"DAD","It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married goes in the chat rooms and...

"LINDA","Well,  you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore!","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"BUTTERS","Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"LINDA","You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Now gosh darn it, you!  You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble!  Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here with you two!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","...Butters... You're as right as rain.","butters'-very-own-episode",79

"CHRIS","We... have an announcement to make, um. Our son has been returned to us.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"MAN IN CROWD","Wow, alright","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"STAN","Butters was missing?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yeah!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"LINDA","We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yeah!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movie- and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Ye-!  wait, what?","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CARTMAN","Huho!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"LINDA","And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"STAN","Damn, dude.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","So you see, there was no ""some Puerto Rican guy."" He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, ""You're a liar! You're a LIAR!""  ""You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag LIAR!!""  Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, ""Hello,"" but they'd be thinking, ""Ah, there goes that MURDERER!"" ""You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!!""  And to me, people might say things like,  ""LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned LIAR!!""  And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like,  ""You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!!""  ""CONFESS!!""  ""LIAR!! CONFESS!!"" You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"LINDA","We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CHRIS","And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"STAN","Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CARTMAN","We sure are.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"BUTTERS","I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.","butters'-very-own-episode",79
"CITY WOK OWNER","Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.","jared-has-aides",80

"STAN","Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!","jared-has-aides",80
"SINGER","He's still lookin' good!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Uh hey, fellas.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Hey Kenny","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Okay, Not-Kenny.","jared-has-aides",80
"ANNOUNCER","Hey South Park!  You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6th at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Dude! That's today!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now.","jared-has-aides",80
"CITY WOK OWNER","Hello! City Wok! City Wok I take your order prease!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Excuse me. Could we get through here?","jared-has-aides",80
"MR. GARRISON","Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours!","jared-has-aides",80
"RANDY","Here he comes!","jared-has-aides",80
"SINGER","He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches...","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy!  And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!","jared-has-aides",80
"SOME MEN","Alright!!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is sooo cool.","jared-has-aides",80
"WORKER","Mr. Vogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Sure, let 'em in.  Hi kids.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Wow, Jared!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","What kind of help?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Eh, AIDS?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","I'll bet you can.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Would you like to meet them?","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Them?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","My aides. Scott, Tyler!  Scott is my personal trainer  and Tyler is my dietician.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Oh, ""a i d E s"" aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Yep. Hooray for aides!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","You, you think so. Well, why... should it matter?","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","It matters, dude.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Hmmm.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Ohmigod!  You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","That that's diarrhea.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow I tell you.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","That's a great idea!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Lose weight and make money. I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Meee???","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh you're the fat one.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","But Butters isn't fat.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Buut fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","You mean like Jared?","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penisbutt!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","You wouldn't be a penisbutt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","He used to be fat but not no more","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","City Wok brought him down to a size 4.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Now he's got lots of moneys and girls","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Wow","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Jared, what's this all about?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Uh Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Uhwwwhat???","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together.  What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Am I bummed?!  You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Well of course I knew it.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","I didn't think it was that big of a deal.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Aren't you overreacting a little bit?","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRISTINE","Well Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides  You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple!  Christine! Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","Hello there, children.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","Fifty pounds? Why?","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Uuh, school project.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Marry him?","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Oh no no no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well uh how come? What's wrong with me?","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Ugh.  Wuh. Wuh I can't eat no more.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Chef, we need more food.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHEF","I'm runnin' out, children.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","So how long until we can joke about it?","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Woogh, that's a long time to wait.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Then eat your puke.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","NO!!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh come on! Japanese girls do it.","jared-has-aides",80
"SINGER","He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time...","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway's is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","But,  I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't ...just Subway sandwiches that made me thin.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides!","jared-has-aides",80
"A WOMAN","Is he serious?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Wow! He looks great!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","How do you feel, Butters?","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Ow!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Get a hold of yourself, man!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Alright, now it's time for phase 2.","jared-has-aides",80

"STAN","We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.","jared-has-aides",80
"CITY WOK OWNER","...Why?","jared-has-aides",80

"JARED","Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.","jared-has-aides",80

"CARTMAN","Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well alright then.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","ROW you fat bitch!! Look at those jelly rolls!! Nobody loves you!! You're not even a person!!","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides!","jared-has-aides",80
"TYLER","Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.","jared-has-aides",80
"SCOTT","Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.","jared-has-aides",80
"TYLER","Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Wait a minute... you're right!  Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Did you bring the camera?","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Yeah, we're all set.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Well what do you mean?","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Wow.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent pernegation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Hey fellas.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Butters?? What the hell are you doing??","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Yeah, you're still fat!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Well we're supposed to shoot yoru commercial today, you fat piece of crap!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you??","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Well uhyeah, but ah, I don't know...","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Why are you doing this to us?","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","All prepared for liposuction surgery?","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Check.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","That should blah  ah here.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Woahhh!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Alrighty.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Alright, I think it's in.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Bohogh, egh.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Waaaahh.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","There it goes.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Alright, it's working!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Everything's getting dark...","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","We've gotta hurry this up.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","He's losing weight.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh, whoa. Whoa!","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","It's out of control!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Whoa, everything's getting sparkly.","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Oh, crap!","jared-has-aides",80
"STAN","Dude, bail!","jared-has-aides",80
"LINDA","Butters? BUTTERS??","jared-has-aides",80

"BUTTERS","Yes sir.","jared-has-aides",80
"LINDA","This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-performed liposuction surgery in our house?!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Four times, mom.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRIS","Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Yes, sir.","jared-has-aides",80
"CHRIS","Oh huh don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!","jared-has-aides",80
"REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in.","jared-has-aides",80
"JARED","Ladies and gentlemen, a- at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!","jared-has-aides",80

"CARTMAN","Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll tell 'em I'm up to no good!","jared-has-aides",80

"STAN","Well, so much for our money.","jared-has-aides",80
"KYLE","Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Becuase then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Yeah, I don't like shattering fat people's dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded!","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Huh. Huh, uh, uh.","jared-has-aides",80

"BUTTERS","Hu-oh! Goody!","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Uh perfect.","jared-has-aides",80
"CARTMAN","Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back.","jared-has-aides",80
"BUTTERS","Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.","jared-has-aides",80

"LINDA","Freinds, by default.","asspen",81
"RANDY","Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.","asspen",81
"CHRIS","Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","Look you guys, Butters is asleep.","asspen",81
"STAN","He's such a douchebag","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it...","asspen",81
"STAN","Yeah, and then what?","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","And then, you pee on it!  heheh, heheheheheheheh.","asspen",81
"KYLE","No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh","asspen",81
"CHRIS","And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.","asspen",81
"CHRIS","No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation..","asspen",81

"STAN","What's a Hitler?","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?","asspen",81
"STAN","No, I never have.","asspen",81
"CARTMAN","Shh-shh, here he comes.","asspen",81
"BUTTERS","Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?","asspen",81

"CARTMAN","His name is Thumper?","asspen",81
"THUMPER","We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...?  Tiime, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.","asspen",81
"BUTTERS","So where's the part where we have a good time?","asspen",81
"THUMPER","Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here.","asspen",81
"BUTTERS","Wuh that's my face, sir.","asspen",81
"THUMPER","Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together , in the shape of a slice... of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries.  You see that?  Pizza,  French fries,  Pizza,  French fries.","asspen",81
"BUTTERS","Ah hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?","asspen",81

"THUMPER","Okay, you see what he did? He French-fried when he should've piiza'd. You French-fry when you should pizza, you're gonna have a bad time.","asspen",81
"PHIL","And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.","asspen",81
"JOSH","That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!","asspen",81
"RANDY","Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.","asspen",81
"PHIL","Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - ""Not me, I can't afford it."" But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars?","asspen",81
"JOSH","Wow!","asspen",81
"PHIL","Well you see, ""time-share"" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves  You  ""share"" the condo with other investors and pick the  ""time"" you want to stay.","asspen",81
"JOSH","Share,  time.  Time share.","asspen",81
"RANDY","So then it's not really ours.","asspen",81
"PHIL","Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, ""I've got a little place in Aspen.""","asspen",81
"JOSH","Try it. Try saying it. ""I've got a little place in Aspen.""","asspen",81
"THE PARENTS","I've got a little place in Aspen.","asspen",81
"PHIL","Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary ""I've got a nice little place in Aspen""? Hahaha. Just kidding, wives.","asspen",81
"RANDY","Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?","asspen",81

"POLICE CAPTAIN","I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go.","freak-strike",82
"MIDDLE DWARF","What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?","freak-strike",82
"POLICE CAPTAIN","Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people.","freak-strike",82

"JOLINE","You see?  There she goes. There she goes.  OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!","freak-strike",82
"MAURY","What the hell is this?","freak-strike",82
"ELEPHANT MAN","A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of hours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with ""freak"" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, ""Look for the True Freak label""","freak-strike",82
"MAURY","Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-","freak-strike",82
"MAN","They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey.","freak-strike",82
"MAURY","Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!","freak-strike",82
"CARTMAN","Whatevah! I'll crap in my... pants!","freak-strike",82
"CAMERAMAN","Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet.","freak-strike",82
"MAURY","Ah, those damned freaks!","freak-strike",82

"RANCHER","Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.","fun-with-veal",83
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.","fun-with-veal",83
"KIDS","Hi, Rancher Bob.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","They look so delicious.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers.","fun-with-veal",83
"KIDS","Eewwww!!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Aw, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Hey, anybody want a free sample?","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Memememee!","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","And in here, boys and girls, we have our...  veal ranch.  You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Wiat a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Yeppir.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Well, if we called it ""little baby cow"" people might not eat it.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Yeah, I wouldn't have.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Huh, me neither.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","What??","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tommorow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Alriiight!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Yeah.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Pst, Cartman.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","No, Uncle Jesse, no!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Cartman, wake up!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","What? What the hell are you guys doing??","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Come on, we've gotta go!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Where are we going?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","What? Why?","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","So?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset.""","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Oho! So you me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","What?!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Screw you, Cartman!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Go on, dude it's the only way.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","No!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Just do it really fast, and we can go.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Have Butters kiss it.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","No, it has to be Kyle.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Awww!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Oh man, that was soho awesome!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Sick! I felt it on my face!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Hell, I'm not goin' with you!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Hyaaaa!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Heeeey!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime.""","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","You need to freeze some of your ass off.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","O! At least I have as ass, Jew!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","What?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Huuh what's the matter?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","They aren't leaving.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","I dno't know.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't hve that much blood in him!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Eh yeah I do too!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Eh!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Butters has that at his house?","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Hey fellas!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Butters!  Did you bring it?","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","All right!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","""Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser.""","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","What?","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","""Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!""","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Eh, you thnk it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.","fun-with-veal",83
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Hello, Mr. Marsh.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?","fun-with-veal",83
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Stole? A-a-are you sure?","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","I followed a calf-curling path right to your house, ma'am.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHELLEY","Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. Stanley, did you see-?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Aw crap!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!","fun-with-veal",83
"RANDY","Stanley, they belong to him.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHELLEY","Let me hit him, Mom!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and  you don't have a choice!  Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","No!","fun-with-veal",83
"RANDY","Stan, you're behaving like a kid!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the onew who know we were making little baby animals suffer!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Open this door, now!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Kiss my ass!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Oh Jeez, he said ""ass"" to his parents.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","You're getting in pretty deep, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANCHER BOB","Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?","fun-with-veal",83
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Me?? How did I get into this mess?","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","So what happens now?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","We're with you, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Yeah.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","I want out.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Shut up, Cartman.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","We're with you, Stan.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Yeah! Wait-what?","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promosie them the calves will live free, in writing.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","We excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","...No I won't.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. That was very impressive.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Very persuasive.","fun-with-veal",83
"CHRIS","Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try.  Butters? Butters, this is your father.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.","fun-with-veal",83
"CHRIS","Butters? Answer me!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","But they-ah they're angry at me.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. You can tell them...","fun-with-veal",83
"CHRIS","Butters! Right now!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?","fun-with-veal",83
"CHRIS","WHAT?!","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Oh, sweet Jesus.","fun-with-veal",83
"CHRIS","What's gotten into them?","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizza and ice cream.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Oh, God-damnit you guys.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Cartman, stay away from that door!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Round one is over. We made it.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","But we will have to sleep, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes!","fun-with-veal",83
"RANDY","Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.","fun-with-veal",83
"LIANE","Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.","fun-with-veal",83
"LIANE","Oh, all right.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Good night, fellas!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Good night.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Can't go on. Need... food...","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","He might be right, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Aw, heck.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Wait, what is that?  Dude!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Food!","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?","fun-with-veal",83
"LIANE","Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer","fun-with-veal",83
"SHARON","Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","All right!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","See? Now we can hold out for weeks!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Look you guys! Beef jerky!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Yeah! And fried chicken!","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Wha?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Dude, what are you guys doing?","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","We're eating, dude.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Me neither.","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!","fun-with-veal",83
"CARTMAN","Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?","fun-with-veal",83

"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where three insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh","fun-with-veal",83
"FIELD REPORTER","Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.","fun-with-veal",83
"RANDY","We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!","fun-with-veal",83
"FIELD REPORTER","The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.","fun-with-veal",83
"BUTTERS","Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","No, this is exactly what we wanted.","fun-with-veal",83
"KYLE","It is?","fun-with-veal",83
"STAN","Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.","fun-with-veal",83
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to ""Puppoies from Around the World.""","fun-with-veal",83

"RUSSELL CROWE","Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few packers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you??","the-new-terrance-and-phillip-movie-trailer",84

"RUSSELL CROWE","Uh oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means.","the-new-terrance-and-phillip-movie-trailer",84
"KYLE","Who wants to tell him?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","I'll do it.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Butters, could you take a seat, please?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Wuh well, sure.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Wull what is it?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap.""","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Nnnot working out?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Lame","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Lane, yes.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Well, but ah I can get better.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunites elsewhere.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Yes, well, we weren't.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","We're sorry Butters.  Our mind is made up.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Phew.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Who cares?","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them.  And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others.  Fine!  If I am to be an outcast, so be it!  I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it!  From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me!  I will become the greatest supervillain  the world has ever seen!  Where I go, destruction will follow!","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos!","professor-chaos",85
"LINDA","Butters, time for bed.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?","professor-chaos",85
"CLYDE","...What if we don't want to be your friend?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uhwill bow down to me!","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.","professor-chaos",85
"TWEEK","What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!","professor-chaos",85
"DOG POO","I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Towelie is a tough choice because, even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.","professor-chaos",85
"TOWELIE","Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... why is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.","professor-chaos",85
"RIDE OPERATOR","O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","One thing for sure: picking our new freidn isn't gonna be easy.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos!","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten.  If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out.  Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy","professor-chaos",85
"TIMMY","Timmih!","professor-chaos",85
"TWEEK","Oh man! This is too much pressure!","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Tweek.","professor-chaos",85
"TWEEK","Aaarr!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out!","professor-chaos",85
"DOG POO","I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.","professor-chaos",85
"LINDA","Good morning, Butters.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.","professor-chaos",85
"LINDA","No,  I didn't hear about that.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Yeh, you didn't?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?","professor-chaos",85
"CHRIS","Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Nothing.  Nothing!  It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deads covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to take it up a notch!","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Okay, next?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","This looks pretty good.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Yeah,it's not bad. Next?","professor-chaos",85
"TIMMY","Timmay!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Next?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Sit down, boys.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Alrighty then.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard?  It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer!","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk.  Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Ms. Choksondik,","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","What is it, Butters?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go.  Okay, so for instance, children-","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Just go, Butters.  Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Uh, what's the question again?","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Five... times...  one.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Five times one is of course...","professor-chaos",85
"THE CLASS","Five.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Five.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools!","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Who are you?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand!","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Hey! That kid took my last eraser! Come back here, kid!","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.","professor-chaos",85
"MS. CHOKSONDIK","It looks fine, Butters.  Okay, hold on and stay here, children.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","You're such a fatass, Cartman!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Shut up, fatass!","professor-chaos",85
"CRAIG","Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!","professor-chaos",85
"LINDA","Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","A note?","professor-chaos",85
"LINDA","Here you go.  And wash your hands after you touch those hamster - you'll get AIDS","professor-chaos",85
"AIDS"," AIDS","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?","professor-chaos",85
"PIP","They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.","professor-chaos",85
"TWEEK","O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!","professor-chaos",85

"PIP","Really? I don't believe it.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Towelie.","professor-chaos",85
"PIP","What?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Just one mroe rose, Kyle.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Jimmy.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Oh boy! Oh thank God!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out!","professor-chaos",85
"CLYDE","This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","Hey Butters.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- come back minions.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Join me?","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","But why?","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","General Disarray.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Now let us go look for my minions! They ran away here, now to find 'em...","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","The swinsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh-","professor-chaos",85
"TOWELIE","Okay wait...  No, no wait.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Next please.","professor-chaos",85
"TOKEN","Well, what am I supposed to do?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Anything that'll impress us, Token.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?","professor-chaos",85
"TOKEN","Aaaah. Oh, I know.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Very nice.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","I like it.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.","professor-chaos",85
"ANNOUNCER","There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.","professor-chaos",85
"ALL","Woohoo!","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Yeah! Isn't this great?!","professor-chaos",85
"VENDOR","Kids, get your drinks here.","professor-chaos",85
"PIP","Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!","professor-chaos",85
"PIP","Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next!","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Okay, let's try this.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!","professor-chaos",85
"WOMAN","I don't wanna die,  I DON'T WANNA DIE!","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch!","professor-chaos",85
"FANS","Yeah! All right!","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray?","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","It's on all the way.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die!  Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","I think Towelie is awesome.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Oh, this is giving me a headache.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? He's quiet and he takes direction well.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","How about Token?","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Token's a smartass.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","So? You're a smartass!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Yeah. Do we really need another one?","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Good point.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Oh, thanks Jimmy","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","That's great.","professor-chaos",85
"KYLE","Cool.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Alright Jimmy, see ya.","professor-chaos",85
"STAN","Suckup.","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. Hey, who is that?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","What do we do now?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but-  but now they have left me with no other choice!","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend.","professor-chaos",85
"JIMMY","Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please.","professor-chaos",85
"CARTMAN","Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","This is is, General Disarray. My final solution.","professor-chaos",85
"DOUGIE","What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?","professor-chaos",85
"BUTTERS","Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the","professor-chaos",85
"TWEEK","I can't.  You do it.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Just stick it on.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","But what if I put it in the wrong place?","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"STAN","Just put it between his eyes.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"STAN","Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Yeah.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"BUTTERS","Hey, fellas.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"STAN","Oh, hey Butters.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"BUTTERS","How are things... oing with your new best friend?","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","Arrrr!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"BUTTERS","Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Yeah.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"BUTTERS","Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"STAN","Uh oh.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","It's not?","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","No way.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","Look!  Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Nuh uh.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","No way.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"CARTMAN","Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tonorrow!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"STAN","Alright, I'll chip in.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"TWEEK","Gah! Me too.","simpsons-already-did-it",86
"KYLE","Naw, alright.","simpsons-already-did-it",86

"PRIEST MAXI","Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ELDERLY PRIEST","How do you mean?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","No.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!","red-hot-catholic-love",87

"OTHER CARDINALS","Et dominus...","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Chuch. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FATHER MAXI","That's right-wait. What?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FRENCH CARDINAL","In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"MOROCCAN CARDINAL","In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FATHER MAXI","Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FATHER MAXI","Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"BRITISH CARDINAL","Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"THE CLERGY","Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"GELGAMEK CARDINAL","Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem.","red-hot-catholic-love",87

"CARTMAN","Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"KYLE","What?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"CARTMAN","It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought-","red-hot-catholic-love",87

"PRIEST MAXI","Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FRENCH CARDINAL","What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","Well, for one, no sex with boys.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ANOTHER CARDINAL","The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FRENCH CARDINAL","Women?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"GELGAMEK CARDINAL","The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"GELGAMEK CARDINAL","What's that about the Gelgameks?!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","Why not?!","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ANOTHER CARDINAL","Because we don't know where it is.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"ITALIAN CARDINAL","You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"PRIEST MAXI","But if we locate it we can make changes to it?","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"A BISHOP","HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattle snakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!","red-hot-catholic-love",87

"MARTHA STEWART","In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can be inserted into the ass is essential.  Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto.  Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"FBI AGENT","Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.","red-hot-catholic-love",87
"MARTHA STEWART","Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey,  right now.  Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound.  When it's done we'll get something like this. So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out.  Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh. Phew.

Stories that are meant to help people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person. That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this.  People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths!","red-hot-catholic-love",87

"KYLE","You?? Why?","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.","free-hat",88

"CARTMAN","What could possibly go wrong?","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCollough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCollough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek.","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","Gaaarh!","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","Well, Hat McCollough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as ""positive"" about toddler murder?","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","Yes... It is easy.  Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?","free-hat",88
"KYLE","We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.","free-hat",88

"GEORGE LUCAS","Oh hi, Ted.","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?","free-hat",88
"STEVEN SPIELBERG","Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.","free-hat",88
"GEOGRE LUCAS","You're here.","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!","free-hat",88
"STEVEN SPIELBERG","And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.","free-hat",88
"KYLE","Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","Yeah, we're children.","free-hat",88
"STAN","Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.","free-hat",88
"TED KOPPEL","How so?","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?","free-hat",88
"GEORGE LUCAS","I'm not a Jew!","free-hat",88
"STEVEN SPIELBERG","You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ewver did.","free-hat",88

"STEVEN SPIELBERG","Wait a minute. What'd you say?","free-hat",88
"GEORGE LUCAS","Eh, that's brilliant!","free-hat",88
"STEVEN SPIELBERG","Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!","free-hat",88
"KYLE","No. NOO!!","free-hat",88

"CARTMAN","Thank you.  Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.","free-hat",88

"CROWD","YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!","free-hat",88
"KYLE","Nonono! We need to do this first.","free-hat",88

"CROWD","YEAH!","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?","free-hat",88

"STAN","Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider","free-hat",88
"SKEETER","He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.","free-hat",88
"CROWD","YEAH!  Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!","free-hat",88
"STAN","Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","No! Not this! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create!","free-hat",88
"KYLE","We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?","free-hat",88

"TWEEK","Haaah!","free-hat",88
"CARTMAN","People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?","free-hat",88
"STAN","Okay, go.","free-hat",88
"TWEEK","I'm breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.","free-hat",88

"GEORGE LUCAS","It is... too late for me, boys.","free-hat",88
"KYLE","You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.","free-hat",88
"GEORGE LUCAS","M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them","free-hat",88
"STAN","You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.","free-hat",88

"COUNSELOR MACKEY","M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"CLYDE","Hey Token. You know, I never noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"ALL THE BOYS","Yeah!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Dude! Bebe is really smart!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","Yeah, may be.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars.""","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"COUNSELOR MACKEY","M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"BEBE","""My cat Thumper.""","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"THE BOYS","Wwooww.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","""Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CLYDE","Chase his tail? That must be so funny?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","""Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end.""","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"THE BOYS","Wwooww!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CRAIG","That's true, huh? Man, that makes me really reflect on my pet.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","That's such a great paper!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"WENDY","But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CLYDE","Have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","No!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Maybe she's in the lunch line.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"THE BOYS","Yeah.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"RED","You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","I heard that her asshole is this big around.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Hey guys.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"RED","Slut.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","Slut.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"GIRLS","Whore. Slut. Slut.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today.  They called me a slut, with a huge gaping vagina.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","But am I slutty just because I'm beginning to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Well if the girls don't wanna be my friend, that's fine!  Guys are way cooler, anyways.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"TWEEK","You... guys wanted me to meet you here?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"TWEEK","Oh God.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Yeah.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Yep.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Right.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Uh huh.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Yeah.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","That would be best.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Huh??","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Kyle??","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"KYLE","Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"CARTMAN","And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"KYLE","No way! Tweek's cool!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Yeah!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"TOKEN","Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"THE OTHER BOYS","Uh huh.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"WENDY","Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"A DOCTOR","Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","I wanna have breast-reduction surgery.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","You?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","I think it's insane to want them bigger.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Why do you... hate your breasts so?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"DR. HALLIS","Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"STAN","Ahah","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"RANDY","Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Ahta?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"RANDY","But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"STAN","Friend. Ahta.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"RANDY","I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"SHARON","I love you.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"MRS. STEVENS","Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"MRS. STEVENS","Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"BEBE","That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","Yes! I want to get breast implants!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"MRS. TESTABURGER","I tried to tell her she was too young.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"MRS. TESTABURGER","But she's eight!","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","That's what I said.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone.  I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"WENDY","I have three thousand dollars, cash.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","You pass. Let's do this thing.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"MRS. TESTABURGER","Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure.  What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"MRS. TESTABURGER","I still don't know about this.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have to be a thousand dollars?","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89
"DR. HALLIS","Cha!  Gotta!  Jam it!  Up there!  Get! In!  There!  You!  Bitch!  Get!  In! There!  You!  Bitch!  Hah!  Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.","bebe's-boobs-destroy-society",89

"CARTMAN","AH!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Hey Kenny.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Hey Kenny.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KENNY","(Hey you guys. What's goin' on, man?)","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He was born where hungry children cry, kickin', his whole family resides in the ghetto, in the ghetto","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KENNY","(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","What did you say?!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KENNY","(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","What did you say?!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","You're too fat to be Kenny.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","You're a- stupid Jew.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven.  Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here  we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"DICK CHENEY","That... kinda looks like a seagull.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","That tricky bastard!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must...  bomb heaven!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SNN REPORTER","SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"WAR PROTESTER","War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"REDNECK","We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"FAT MAN","I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States...  then there would-  hard nipples!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SNN REPORTER","God-damnit!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and caption the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","No, we have to see Kenny!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SHARON","You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Cremated? What's that?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","What?? For God's sake, why??","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Are you gonna burn me?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Jesus Christ!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STUART","You WHAT??","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Shut up!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","You did, dude! You drank his whole body!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Shut up!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"LIANE","Bad, Eric, bad!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Yeah. Good job, fatass!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Looks like I've come to the right place.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"NURSE","Can I help you?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"NURSE","You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BOYFRIEND","It's gonna be okay, babe.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91

"LOLLY","There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KENNY","(Okay.)","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God!  You guys! YOU GUYS!!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not responded.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"INDIAN AMBASSADOR","Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Right. Dead, and in heaven.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"ANOTHER AMBASSADOR","This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him about August.  When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment.  Question?  Yes?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"ANOTHER AMBASSADOR","Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","I assure you, I am not high.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","What do you mean, fatass?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Where??","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Do you see anything?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Not by giving me brain damage!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...","a-ladder-to-heaven",91

"RANDY","What?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SHARON","See for yourself!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SNN CORRESPONDENT","This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben.  The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. Therefore hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"NATSAKO SEMU","Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91

"BUSH","Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SHARON","Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"SOME GUY","Dude.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GEORGE BUSH","Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CARTMAN","...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"FIELD REPORTER","But... what about yoru lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"GENERAL","So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"JOHNSON","Sir!","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"RANDY","No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"CROWD","Awwww.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"BUSH","And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"ALAN JACKSON","Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there?","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"KYLE","Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91
"STAN","Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.","a-ladder-to-heaven",91

"BUTTERS","Well then, then let me go with you.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KYLE","Okay, fine Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"BUTTERS","My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... preciousss.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan's's house.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KYLE","This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"STAN","Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"KYLE","You can't keep it.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"BUTTERS","The preciousss?  Could you bring back my preciousss?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CHRIS","Butters, where is the movie you were watching?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"BUTTERS","They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"RANDY","The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"SHARON","Oh no.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KYLE","We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","I must say I agree. If this copy of the Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"STAN","Oh crap, dude!","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"KYLE","Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"STAN","Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KYLE","Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"RANDY","And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"RANDY","I'm a...fraid it was... Back Door Sluts 9.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"LINDA","Is that bad?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CHRIS","Back Door Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"SHARON","We're sorry.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"LIANE","Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"RANDY","It it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"STAN","We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","Oh. Okay, hang on a second.  What troubles you?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KYLE","We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... the Lord of the Rings.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"STAN","Yes, but this is not a-  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"OTHER SIXTH GRADERS","Ahhhhh!","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please?","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"OTHER BOYS","Ahhh.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"JIMMY","That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f- ...forces.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CRAIG","It could hold a mental spell of some kind.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"KEVIN","Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CARTMAN","Kevin, God-damnit!","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"STAN","But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"CLYDE","That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92
"TOKEN","I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape,  just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me.  The fate of Middle Earth... is in my hands.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"CARTMAN","Talangar the Black returns from watching the video.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"STAN","I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"KYLE","Paladin!","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"RANDY","A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh this is called ""sixty-nining"" and it's normal.","the-return-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-to-the-two-towers",92

"MR. GARRISON","I'm aware of that.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Wow, that's... really great to hear.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, for real? You're not kidding?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"MR. GARRISON","You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","It's for real, Mr. Garrison.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Oh-ho, great!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"BUTTERS","Where is Mr. Hat, sir?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... Mr. Slave.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","Hi kids. Hm.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","So that's  Mr. Slave.  The teacher's assitant.  Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","Oh Jesus Christ.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"MR. SLAVE","Oh Jesus Christ.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","No, it was Kenny!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"THE OTHER KIDS","Yeah.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishmenmt!  Take it Mr. Slave!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","I will  NOT put up with  TOMfoolery in my  CLASSroom, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"LINDA","Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Hey guys, can we talk to you?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"SHARON","How was school?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"LINDA","Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHRIS","Uh huh.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"TOUR GUIDE","Now you know how it feels.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labled minorities. Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","That's right. But of course, we know that all Arabs are terrorirsts, don we, kids?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"BUTTERS","W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","Look, a covetous Jew!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican.""","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"JANITOR","Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"JANITOR","Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tire. Ongh, so sleepy.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays , because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight,  like this young man here.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","Ey!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""...","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","""Fat tits."" That's a good one.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Yeah, I have to remember that.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","That's our Cartman.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"TOUR GUIDE","Well, that's the end of our tour.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"THE BOYS","Yeah.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today.  Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"BUTTERS","It evaporates.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","AAH.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"AAH."," AAH.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"BUTTERS","Sure.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Oh, no, noo, no no no no.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","AAH.  AAH.  Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"CHEF","How's it goin'?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Bad.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Why bad?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Chef, we're intolerant.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","...Intolerant of who?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Gays, I guess.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children?  I thought you knew better.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me unconfortable?""","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Are we homophobes now?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"KYLE","We don't wanna be gaybashers, Chef.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","N-no?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CARTMAN","I'll take three lunches today, please.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. Now we'll get fired for sure!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh!  Oooooh, Jesus Christ.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"FROG KING","Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die. This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach. Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"SINGER","A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching meathods.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Nonono we're not firing you.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","...You're not?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","You demostrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words ""sick queer"" to describe his conduct in class?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","He IS a sick queer!!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHEF","Kiss my black ass!!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"RANDY","Well I really thought you boys really learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"BUTTERS","But they killed Lemmiwinks!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHRIS","Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"BUTTERS","Yes sir.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CHRIS","Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"SHARON","That sounds good to me.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"LIANE","Mee too.","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"STAN","Tolerance camp?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"CAMP WARDEN","Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences.  Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody.

"MR. GARRISON","God-damnit!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","How'd it go?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. SLAVE","The principal didn't fire you?","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93
"MR. GARRISON","No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!","the-death-camp-of-tolerance",93

"STAN","Does this month, November, hold a special significance?","the-biggest-douche-in-the-universe",94
"STAN","Right, because he's saying, ""Tell her 'Happy Brithday.'""","the-biggest-douche-in-the-universe",94
"STAN","See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.","the-biggest-douche-in-the-universe",94
"STAN","I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""","the-biggest-douche-in-the-universe",94
"STAN","Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""","the-biggest-douche-in-the-universe",94

That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died.

You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but thnk about it: Is that really what you want?

"STAN","No!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SINGER","One of them's messy, the other one's clean!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Quit it!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SINGER","But in the end we know we're good for each other","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Hey guys.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Who's this asshole?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"KYLE","Wow. That's pretty cool.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Then how does he know our names?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"KYLE","'Cause, artard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Shut up, Cartman!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","That is so awesome!! Thank you God! Oh praise God!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"KYLE","Hey, what happens to me in the future?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Juvi Hall!  Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","God-damnit!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy!  Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... Wait a minute, what'd you say?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Dude, how long has your future self been around?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh. I guess it's been around four months now.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Nobody asked.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Where is he now?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Probably watching Becker.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BECKER","My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE BUTTERS","Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"LINDA","Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Liver medicine?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  Amd I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Alright, where is that sonofabitch's wallet?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Here it is.  It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this?  This expires in two thousand two. Why does he have this in his wallet?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","I don't follow.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh! Are we out for an adventure?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Here it is. Motivation Corp.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","What the hell is going on here?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"A VOICE","It should take about a month to achieve the results you want.  Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MR. BROOKS","We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"JOSH","Nice to meet you, ""Mom and Dad.""","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MRS. BROOKS","My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MR. CASHER","I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MRS. BROOKS","Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MR. BROOKS","Heh it sure should, heh.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Alright, then we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MR. BROOKS","Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"MRS. BROOKS","""Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future."" Oh this is going to be fun.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I can't believe it! It's all a scam!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Yeah, I can't believe it!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","They've all been lying to us this whole time!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this?  Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Eh, but then why did they come back to the past","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Who's that?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","What?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Now you know my terrible secret!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Wow, look at this, Stan.  ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed.""","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hey look, somebody lost their pet.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America?  Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Look, you can make your weiner bigger in just three weeks.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","This lady'll massage your weiner for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Fine, then you can come with me.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hooray!  And then we can make our weiners bigger, and have the lady massage them.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I guess this is it.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Yes, come in, please.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Cartman??","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","What the hell are you doing here?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've beenhelping children get back at their parents ever since.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business hre with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Yeah!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","How much is this going to cost us?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","I think he's pretty scared alright.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Well that makes sense.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. Or that... one pill of Ecstacy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I thnk I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Poop- poop swatches?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Now, personally, I like the baby green. But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Well that sounds good.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Hooray!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yeah.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yeah.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yeah!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Wow! Neato!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","That's not neato, that sucks.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","What?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought his revenge was unique and customized!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Dude!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","No, that's too extreme!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Hey future self.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Yes, former self?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Oh, uh...","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","You must know what I'm talking about.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Sure uh, uh,  oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Uh, Stan,  don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Oh. You. You don't?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole futre self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Well, you know what I think, Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","What?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","I think he IS from the future.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Yeah, he must be.  It's like, I jsut feel he's our son, you know?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Right.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FELIPE","ü¾™¦ˆ¼Quü¾Ž–”¼? ü¾™¦ˆ¼La caca no esta aquü¾™†”¼?","my-future-self-n'-me",95

"CARLOS","Sü¾™†”¼. Marrado.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Marrado. Spectacularrr.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARLOS","Sü¾™†”¼.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","God, it's so hard to find good help. Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Boy, it sure is stinky in here!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ü¾Œ–„¼Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up-","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Oh, Stan!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstaris and play hide and go seek?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Hide and go seek, huh?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I don't believe that he's my future self!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","No, I actually have a way to be sure. I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","But I have to know for sure.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Stan...","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yes?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Uh... nothing. Go ahead.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Randy!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","AAAH!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE STAN","Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Ooo, ah, that's a different company. Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ü¾™†„¼ü¾Œ–„¼Vamonos!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh, Stan!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Butters, we're running away!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","We are?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CHRIS","What the hell is this?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"LINDA","Oh my God, our house!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CHRIS","Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"BUTTERS","Oh, not really sir, I just uh...","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"LINDA","Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CHRIS","What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Huh?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CHRIS","Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"LINDA","We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CHRIS","We though the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"LINDA","We're sorry, baby.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Get the fuck out of here.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"DIRECTOR","Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"RANDY","You really did a nice job, Eric.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"STAN","Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"SHARON","Well here, Eric, I baked you a huge box of cookies as a present.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE CARTMAN","Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN","Who the hell are you?","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"FUTURE CARTMAN","Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future.  I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!","my-future-self-n'-me",95
"CARTMAN",NA,"my-future-self-n'-me",95
"COUSIN KYLE","Av-a-a-alright, I'm done.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","You're done?","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Yeah, so how's it look?","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","a-a-aactually it looks like you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","What?!","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is is, is bad.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one?","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Yes, wa-a-I didn't think ""hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot"" really counted as nice.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Hey hey,  I'm just your naughty-and-nice accoutant! Don't blame me for the numbers!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","If you cure cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Jesus Christ!","red-sleigh-down",96
"COUSIN KYLE","Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever.","red-sleigh-down",96

"CARTMAN","I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us.  Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, their is no Christmas. They have nothing.","red-sleigh-down",96
"JIMBO","Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda.  Light the damn tree!","red-sleigh-down",96
"TOWNSFOLK","YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!","red-sleigh-down",96

"TOWNSFOLK","Awww","red-sleigh-down",96
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?","red-sleigh-down",96
"TOWNSFOLK","Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!","red-sleigh-down",96

Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.","red-sleigh-down",96
"STAN","Cartman, why are you doing this?","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.","red-sleigh-down",96
"KYLE","That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?","red-sleigh-down",96
"A VOICE","Hoooowwwwdy ho!","red-sleigh-down",96

"CARTMAN","The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit!  I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Really?","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!","red-sleigh-down",96

"KYLE","Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??","red-sleigh-down",96
"STAN","I don't know.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train.","red-sleigh-down",96
"JIMMY","...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Here we are, kids. The North Pole.","red-sleigh-down",96

"CARTMAN","Wow, is that where Santa lives?","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.","red-sleigh-down",96
"KYLE","Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Howdy ho, Santa!","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Mr. Hankey, how are you?","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","All ready for Christmas?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Oh, that's so lame of them.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","That's what I thought.","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Gnomes!  Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","All right!","red-sleigh-down",96

"STAN","Hang on, Santa!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.","red-sleigh-down",96
"STAN","Wny would Iraqis do that? Why?","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","North Pole. This is Santa.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Santa! Are you alright?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me!  Stay back, you bastards! Stay back!","red-sleigh-down",96

"CARTMAN","Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!","red-sleigh-down",96
"KYLE","Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.","red-sleigh-down",96
"STAN","Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Oh, Christ.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.","red-sleigh-down",96

"KYLE","What are you doing?","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.","red-sleigh-down",96
"KYLE","Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!","red-sleigh-down",96
"KYLE","All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!","red-sleigh-down",96
"CARTMAN","It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...","red-sleigh-down",96

"IRAQI GENERAL","Why you come to Iraq, my main man?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","To bring happiness and joy to the children.","red-sleigh-down",96
"IRAQI GENERAL","And this is...?  This is what you think brings happy?  This is material... This is commercialism! My country is sick. Sick!","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit.  What's going on here?!","red-sleigh-down",96
"IRAQI GENERAL","America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan?","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","I don't know, I live in the North Pole. What are you doing??","red-sleigh-down",96
"IRAQI GENERAL","They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with a little shock to the testicles.","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","Oh no. Not Santa's balls!","red-sleigh-down",96
"IRAQI GENERAL","What else is America planning?!","red-sleigh-down",96
"SANTA","I'm gonna fucking kill you!","red-sleigh-down",96
"IRAQI GENERAL","You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!","red-sleigh-down",96

"JESUS","We have to get him out of there.","red-sleigh-down",96
"MR. HANKEY","Do you know a way?","red-sleigh-down",96

"CARTMAN","Eh-ih... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.","cancelled",97
"STAN","No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","No I don't remember that!","cancelled",97
"KYLE","You don't?","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","No, because the aliens erased my memory!","cancelled",97
"STAN","I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Hello there, children!","cancelled",97

"STAN","It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","What is a proc-tologist, Chef?","cancelled",97
"CHEF","He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.","cancelled",97
"STAN","You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","That's right.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","What a dick!","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","Hello everyone!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","What seems to be the problem?","cancelled",97
"CHEF","We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.","cancelled",97

"PROCTOLOGIST","All right, let's take a look.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Eow.","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","Wait, what's this?","cancelled",97
"KYLE","Are you okay?","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Well, doctor?","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!","cancelled",97
"STAN","You all right?","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!","cancelled",97
"PROCTOLOGIST","I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!","cancelled",97
"STAN","Where to now, Chef?","cancelled",97
"CHEF","That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.","cancelled",97
"JEFF","How do we uh, make it come out?","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle.","cancelled",97
"STAN","What?","cancelled",97
"KYLE","No way!  You do it, Kenny!","cancelled",97

"CARTMAN","Okay.  Ohhh! God-damnit!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Okay. Now it's funny again.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","That does it! CHARGE!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","What's it doing?","cancelled",97
"JEFF","It, it's sending a transmission of some kind.  Got it!","cancelled",97
"KYLE","It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Where is the signal being sent to?","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?","cancelled",97

"KYLE","Candy bars?","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Yu-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to!  What the heck?  They're coming in!","cancelled",97
"STAN","What do we do???","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!","cancelled",97

"THE BOYS","Cheeeeeeef!","cancelled",97
"NARRATOR","Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.","cancelled",97
"STAN","Uh.  Wugh. You guys. Wake up!","cancelled",97

"JEFF","When I reversed the polarities, I found this:  It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Wait a minute! Butt sex!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Butt sex?","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra 's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore.

"STAN","I like it.","cancelled",97
"KENNY","(Me too.)","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings.  I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.","cancelled",97
"STAN","You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches.","cancelled",97
"STAN","Television?","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real.  We started with great shows like, ""Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?"" and ""Antares 6 Millionaire"". And then we had a big hit with ""Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian"". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","Earth?","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","A few billion years ago we realized, ""what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?"" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great!","cancelled",97
"STAN","Our planet is just a reality-TV show?","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!","cancelled",97
"KYLE","You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","Why?","cancelled",97
"STAN","Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth!","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe.  When decoded, it looks like this.","cancelled",97
"MAN","What does it mean?","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Ih it's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this.","cancelled",97
"ANNOUNCER","This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!","cancelled",97
"JEFF","I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Waaaait, you don't understand!","cancelled",97
"OTHERS","Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!!","cancelled",97
"ALIEN","That should get the relay working again. All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth.  Oh, excuse me.  This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks.  Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","What?? Who cancelled us?","cancelled",97
"NAGIX","The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be fuinny anymore.","cancelled",97
"STAN","Oh shit, did we do that?","cancelled",97
"NAGIX","Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled","cancelled",97
"STAFF","Awww.","cancelled",97
"NAGIX","Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud.  Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.","cancelled",97
"STAN","Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!","cancelled",97
"NAGIX","Wouldn't do any good.","cancelled",97
"KYLE","Dude, we have to try!","cancelled",97
"STAN","Please, take us to them! Please!","cancelled",97
"NAGIX","All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody.","cancelled",97
"CHEF","What the hell is that?!","cancelled",97
"JEFF","There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit!  But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Chaos theory??","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Chaos theory, ih wah, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled...","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Huh?","cancelled",97
"JEFF","Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are cancelling Earth!","cancelled",97

"JEFF","Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it!  Wait a minute, jackets!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","Oh no.","cancelled",97
"JEFF","If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!","cancelled",97
"CHEF","That doesn't make any God-damned sense!","cancelled",97
"STAN","Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","No.","cancelled",97
"STAN","No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!","cancelled",97
"KYLE","The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.","cancelled",97
"STAN","I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.","cancelled",97
"CARTMAN","There's even World War Three to look forward to.","cancelled",97

"BUTTERS","You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!","krazy-kripples",98
"BUTTERS","Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.","krazy-kripples",98

"KYLE","What?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!","krazy-kripples",98

"MCGILLICUDDY","Hello, boys. What can I do for you?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning.","krazy-kripples",98
"MCGILLICUDDY","Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Why not?","krazy-kripples",98
"MCGILLICUDDY","Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","...There's already a Crips?!","krazy-kripples",98
"MCGILLICUDDY","Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?","krazy-kripples",98
"MCGILLICUDDY","...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmmeh!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.","krazy-kripples",98
"KING","My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who,. with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Thanks for having me on again, Larry.","krazy-kripples",98
"KING","All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you. Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that takling cells from a fetus is... unethical.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated  about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one  can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.","krazy-kripples",98
"KING","And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Well, it's very simple.  And now you can see, my arms have better movement.","krazy-kripples",98
"KING","Wow.  Wow.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.","krazy-kripples",98
"BUM","You are?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.","krazy-kripples",98
"BUM","The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there,  but ...nobody goes in there.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmmih!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Well hello everyone.  I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.","krazy-kripples",98
"LARGE CRIP","Is they for real, manh?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?","krazy-kripples",98
"BRAIDED CRIP","The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.","krazy-kripples",98
"TALL CRIP","Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","I agree. I mean, it's like  ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?","krazy-kripples",98

"JIMMY","Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmih!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park.","krazy-kripples",98
"OFFICER","Hey you kids.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Well hello, officers.","krazy-kripples",98

"TIMMY","Timmih!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.","krazy-kripples",98

"BUFF CRIP","You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac!  Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!","krazy-kripples",98

"REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Thank you everyone.  To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me,  it's hope.","krazy-kripples",98
"CROWD","Uugh.","krazy-kripples",98
"MR. GARRISON","What an inspiration.","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now?","krazy-kripples",98
"STAN","Stay clear, guys, stay clear.","krazy-kripples",98
"KYLE","Yup. I'm not seeing anything.","krazy-kripples",98

"MAMSIE","And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!","krazy-kripples",98
"RYAN","Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.","krazy-kripples",98
"RYAN","That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left.","krazy-kripples",98

"HACKMAN","I'm good. You?","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","I am better with each passing day. Stronger and more agile.","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","What?","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am...  Chris!","krazy-kripples",98

"RICHARDSON","Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","The... B-Bloods?","krazy-kripples",98
"HYDE","You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","The-they do??","krazy-kripples",98
"RICHARDSON","Don't act like you don't know, you lil punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","But... but why do they hate each other?","krazy-kripples",98
"HYDE","Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?","krazy-kripples",98
"HYDE","Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed.","krazy-kripples",98
"RYAN","Sarah!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Tim-mih.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmih!!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmih!!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","This is gonna be t-terrific!","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head.","krazy-kripples",98
"RANDY","Oh, what a fighter.","krazy-kripples",98
"LIANE","He's an imspration to us all.","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","Chris, that's enough!","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Hello, Gene! So good to see you!","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't knw what is.","krazy-kripples",98
"HACKMAN","They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!!  You won't stop me, Hack Man!  Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa!  Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.","krazy-kripples",98

"TIMMY","Timmih!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.","krazy-kripples",98
"REPORTER","Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom!  The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be commited to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.","krazy-kripples",98
"REEVE","I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery,  Their desire for world conquest, and their hatred of all things good!

"BUFF CRIP","Wait a minute. What did you say?","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","I said, ""I mean,  Come on!""","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","Come on.","krazy-kripples",98

"ALL","Yeah, that's right. Come on.","krazy-kripples",98
"BUFF CRIP","I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.","krazy-kripples",98
"BLOOD","Right on!","krazy-kripples",98
"CRIP","Hey little Roller, try some of this chronic shit.","krazy-kripples",98
"TIMMY","Timmih!","krazy-kripples",98
"JIMMY","I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?","krazy-kripples",98
"GANG MEMBERS","It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along,","krazy-kripples",98
"TEACHER","Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Put more clay on the balls.","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","Boys!  What is that?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","A reindeer?","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","What a crime.","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","You think art is not important?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","I love our class!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","See?","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","Do you think this is funny?!  Do you think this is funny, huh?!  Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","You can't do that!","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","I certainly can! I'm your teacher!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","You're an art teacher!","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","Make it two hours!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Mrs. Dreible thinks she's so cool!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","How dare she talk to us like that?!","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","We can't let her get away with this! I think tonight we need to do something drastic.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Like what?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Like find out where Mrs. Dreible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","TP her house?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? Ugh!","toilet-paper",99
"TEACHER","Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","D'you think that's enough?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Should be fine.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum.","toilet-paper",99
"CASHIER","Hello boys. Find everything you need?","toilet-paper",99

"KYLE","You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh.  Uuugh.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Is this the right house?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","It's the right address-wait! Look there! There's Mrs. Dreible! This is the place.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","So?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Kyle, we all agreed to do this!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch!","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Yeah! Fuck you!)","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Come on, let's go!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","What have we done?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Let's go, Kyle!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Aw man, that was sooo awesome!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Who cares??","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Me??  There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Noo! No.  Noo!","toilet-paper",99
"MRS. DREIBLE","AAAAAAAAA!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!","toilet-paper",99
"THE DREIBLE GIRLS","Mommy! Mommy!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Whyyy? Whyyy?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Ah! Oh God! Oh God!","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Dreible's house got covered with toilet paper.","toilet-paper",99
"CLYDE","Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Dreible probably had it comin' to her.","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. GARRISON","Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Damn!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh God!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Yes, dude!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Oh, for Christ's sake!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?","toilet-paper",99
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Me??)","toilet-paper",99
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Touchü¾Ž–”¼, Mr. Mackey, touchü¾Ž–”¼.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Why are they doing us one at a time?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I can get a better deal?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","There we go. That should be about the last of it.  Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Crime scene investigation!  There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator?","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Lo-ih ih it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","I was here.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Aha!! Got you!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Officer, why would I TP my own house?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Insurance?","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","You really have nothing better to do, do you?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","No I do not.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Noo! No.  Noo!","toilet-paper",99
"MRS. DREIBLE","AAAAAAAAA!","toilet-paper",99
"MR. DREIBLE","Oh, Jesus no! Our house!","toilet-paper",99
"THE DREIBLE GIRLS","Mommy! Mommy!","toilet-paper",99
"NANCY KERRIGAN","Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","No need. I have one for you right here.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Oh. Okay. Thanks.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Is there anything else I can get for you?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","You do that. Goodnight, Kyle.","toilet-paper",99
"WARDEN","Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year.  He's a real monster.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","I just need to talk to someonen who knows how toilet paperers think.","toilet-paper",99
"WARDEN","Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance.  He's the last cell on your left.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Nno, but it was worth a try, doesn't it?  Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Well, that's kind of personal.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them.  Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professional, at least one of them is.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","So you think there was more than one. Why?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt!","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","What about him?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(I think so too.)","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Ha-ey fellas.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Butters.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","So what should we do?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Why not?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us.","toilet-paper",99
"CASHIER","You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. I'm... sorry I have to do this.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. BELL","Oh my God.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Is this toilet paper from your store?","toilet-paper",99
"MR. BELL","It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Positive ID on the toilet paper.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. BELL","Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?","toilet-paper",99
"MR. BELL","Suspicious like how?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.","toilet-paper",99
"MR. BELL","Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store.  Oh my God!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","What's this all about, Cartman?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","A boat ride?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Well, okay.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","And you feel like you have to confess.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow. What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Cartman!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Won't be long, Kyle.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Josh, I need your help.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","How do you mean?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Yes.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Single-sheet?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","No, two-ply.  What? What does that tell you?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Why does one toilet-paper houses","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","To get revenge.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","What do you mean?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","I don't have time for this, kid.","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool hiyouse?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps!","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Oh. Of course! One of her students!","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make.  Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.","toilet-paper",99
"WARDEN","Josh,  were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?","toilet-paper",99
"JOSH","No, sir.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Cartman, what are you doing?","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","They did?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","They did?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","But can I still kill Kyyyle?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Hello boys. How are you?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","It sure is!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Uh, can we see them-him-her?","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Right over here.  Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked.","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Hey fellas!","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Butters?","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Yep. I'm in jail.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","You con-fessed?","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house.  I don't seem to remember it,  but they're pretty sure it was me.  I just can't get my behavior under control!","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","His parents are on their way down now.","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","You guys, we can't let him do this!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Why do you say that?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Because it was-","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.","toilet-paper",99
"OFFICER BARBRADY","All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I still feel bad, Cartman","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","Yeah. That makes it even worse.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","I know.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","So... so then, how can you feel bad?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","...But he's not gonna get in trouble.","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.","toilet-paper",99
"KENNY","(Yeah, maybe we should.)","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","What?? Eh...  hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!","toilet-paper",99
"KYLE","We feel bad for other people.","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?","toilet-paper",99
"STAN","Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same!","toilet-paper",99
"CARTMAN","Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!","toilet-paper",99
"CHRIS","Well well well! I had to see it to believe it!","toilet-paper",99
"BUTTERS","Hi, Dad.","toilet-paper",99

"PROTESTERS","Yeah! Right!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STUART","If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SUPPORTERS","Yeah! Right!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"CARTMAN","...Eh the... Founding who?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"MR. GARRISON","Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"BUTTERS","Mmuh well, not really, no.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"CLASS","Awwwwww!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"MR. GARRISON","SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"KYLE","Shut up and study!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","What are you doing?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","I'm trying to have a flashback.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KENNY","(A what?)","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","No, you just have to study.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","That isn't gonna work, dumbass!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"MR. SLAVE","Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"PROTESTERS","Hahahaha, yeah.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"JIMBO","You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side o' the town!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"PROTESTER","Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STUART","Well your side has the grocery store.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"JIMBO","Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"JIMBO","W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"TOWNSFOLK","Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","How?!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Okay, people. What are we rabbling about now?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STUART","Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"TOWNSFOLK","Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have have to give the town square to both groups.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"JIMBO","All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"CARTMAN","I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"RANDY","And I'm a little for bringin' them home.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","I believe freedom isn't free.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","No, but war shouldn't be our goal.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","We must defend our country.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","If it means war, then we say NO!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SOMEBODY","Yeehaw!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"SKEETER","We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","Why are we fightin' this war?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"ADAMS","We must go to war!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"DICKINSON","But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"DICKINSON","Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Whoa, how very very relevant.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"TOM","Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"PROTESTERS","Booooo!!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","Uh, we didn't do it.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","What?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","We didn't do our homework.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SHARON","Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SUPPORTERS","Support!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"CONGRESSMEN","Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"DICKINSON","We cannot found a country based on war!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"ADAMS","We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CONGRESSMAN","Rabble!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CONGRESSMEN","Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!  Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"HANCOCK","Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"FRANKLIN","I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"JEFFERSON","Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"DICKINSON","Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"FRANKLIN","And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"ADAMS","It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"HANCOCK","And we will call that country the United States of America.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Wow!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","Everyone, stop! Please!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"TOWNSMAN","The-the child! The child, from the hospital.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","He does?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","He does?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truely great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called ""having your cake and eating it too.""","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","I guess we... owe you an apology.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STUART","Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"TOWNSFOLK","Awww.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"KYLE","Cartman? Cartman saved the day?","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STAN","Can't be","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"CARTMAN","The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","Hey I'm a little bit country","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-eh","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"SKEETER","I'll be the muscle of America","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","And me, I'll be the caring soul.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"TOGETHER","When you put us together you get a nation with one goal","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"RANDY","Come on up here, everybody!","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"EVERYBODY","We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"STUART","We can be a nation that believe in war,","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","And still tells the world that we don't.","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100
"EVERYBODY","Let the flag for hyprocisy fly high from every pole","i'm-a-little-bit-country",100

"KYLE","And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you.","fat-butt-and-pancake-head",101
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.","fat-butt-and-pancake-head",101

"STAN","I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.","fat-butt-and-pancake-head",101

"CARTMAN","Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CHRIS","Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Awww, shit!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CHRIS","I'll do that. Have fun, boys.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Oh, hello there boys.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Really?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool.  And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","My God...","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Have you reported this to any other authorities?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We're on the case.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","What have you got, Marsh?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Detective McCormick found something interesting.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Jesus, we're too late.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","I think we can piece this case together now.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD MAN","Well, what do you thnk happened, little detectives?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Your husband.  He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Slowly the rage built inside his mind. ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","His plan was to use a hammer.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Then saw off the arms and legs.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","The torso he would dump into the lake.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Looks like the game is over, old man!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Just the news.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","All right, all right, you you boys run along now.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OLD WOMAN","Fine, here, just go!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","We're in business!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LIANE","Boys, you have a little visitor.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GIRL","Is this the South Park Crime Unit?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"THE BOYS","Ah! Oh.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Yes it is!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GIRL","I lost my dollie.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all.  And get some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Do you kow where your doll is?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GIRL","If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","All right, Sarah, come over here.  Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"SARAH","She has curly blonde hair. And a red dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","You got it, Ken?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","All right, let's see.  Damnit Kenny, that's not what she said!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Put that away, dude!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","No sign of forced entry.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","But the window isn't locked.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Right, so it's possible that the theif sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brough a shovel to decapitate it.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"A BOY","All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell,  give me smears of all the places the doll used to be!  Mitchell, run a tap on the phone!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Hey, kid, what are you doing?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"THE BOY","Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","...Not anymore, you're not!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Can't we? You guys are playing Detective. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Aw crap!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","I want choppers on the roof ready to go!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Son of a bitch stupid FBI!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Yeah, but how?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Right. I think I know exactly where to start.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Ah, I was at home.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Awww, don't be so hard. Maybe he's tellin' the truth, huh?)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","They've gotten really good at this good cop-bad cop thing.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Aw. Now just be nice. Poor lil thing.)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","You're worth a two-dollar criminal and you're lying!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Aw, please don't make him confess.)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","How do I do that?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","You just make the semen come out of your body and fill it in this cup!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Stop playing games!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","I'm not playing. I really don't know!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","That does it! Wait right here!  Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make seme come out of your body.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","How... do you make semen come out?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your weiner until white stuff comes out.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Really?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and mager...venate your weiner really fast.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","No-o!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Follow me to the bathroom.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Aw, it's okay kid. It's just done in a jiffy)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your weiner until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","My weiner??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Yes, retard. Semen comes from your weiner. Now do it!  Well Butters?!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Ah I'm pullin' on my weiner, but nothin's happening.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Well pull harder!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","...ow... Ow... It's not workin'","lil'-crime-stoppers",102

"BUTTERS","Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'","lil'-crime-stoppers",102

"CARTMAN","The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Okay!!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Let's go!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","...ow... Ow!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","That's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","Yeah, that's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Kyle!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","What?  What??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","They've got the doll!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","Huh huh who is it?!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","They're playing Detective.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","That's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","You're gay!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","What do we do now?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","I don't know.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Dude, we just can't tell on them.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Why not?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","Detectives!  If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","Yeah.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","That's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","We're gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Jesus! They're gonna kill her!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","We've got to do something.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Attention! You in the house!  This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Yeah! This was our hot lead!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way!  The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","No you're not.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Time out, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Yes it does so!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","...Grrrr!!!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(What do we do now?)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We go get the doll ourselves.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","But they said we can't charge the front door.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TUCKER","Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","Huhuh.  Oh crap, they're coming in the back!  That's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","No you didn't!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Did so!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FOSSE","No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102

"FOSSE","We're dead.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BILL","That's gay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We got it.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"SARAH","My dollie!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","We got her back safe. We lost a lot of good men in the process.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We do what we can, sir.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","W-hell, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Jenior Detectives.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Wow!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","That means you boys are now an official part of the department.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Kewl!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","All right, so ready for your first assignment?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Sure.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Ah... a a a meth lab?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","I don't want any problems. Just take them down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one!  On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","What is a meth lab, anyway?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Damn.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle valued at sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixteen thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't have guys to question now, because you killed them all!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","We're sorry.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","Relax, Hopkins!  All fun and games, right?  Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Uh bonus?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that? So you think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","We just wanna be junior detectives.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"HOPKINS","I said, back off Murphy!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","Why don't you and your rookie friends make us","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","What the hell is the problem here??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","No problem, sir. No problem at all.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Then hit the showers, all of ya!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Me neither.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","It'll get better, guys.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Better how, dude?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. See you guys at school tomorrow.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Awwwwrrr-auugh.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LIANE","Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LIANE","Well you should've called Mommy.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LIANE","Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Okay.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Butters?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Yes?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Are you still trying to give a semen sample?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Well, keep tryin', Butters.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BUTTERS","Okay.  Ow. Ooww!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MR. GARRISON","And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MR. GARRISON","Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MR. GARRISON","Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"THE BOYS","Eeagh!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Un oh...","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little ""shoot first ask questions later"" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","No.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","They're dead!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Woohoo!!)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STRIPPER","Would you like a dance?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","No thanks.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STRIPPER","Dance?  Anyone like a dance?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DJ","Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's here it for Candy!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BOUNCER","Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STRIPPER","Dance? Anyone like a dance?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STRIPPER","Oh, really? Let's go see.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"OWNER","All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BOUNCER","Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GINO","What? Ha-I don't know no kids.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"BOUNCER","I didn't think so. All right, you kids-","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GINO","Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TALL GOON","Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GINO","What?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"TALL GOON","These kids are cops, man!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Bang bang bang...","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KENNY","(Pakew! Pakew!)","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!""","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroicly reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STRIPPER","Dance??? Anybody like a dance???","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"HOPKINS","Freeze! South Park detectives!  Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GINO","Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"HOPKINS","A deal?","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these ""supercops"" joined the force.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"JENKINS","Now we've gotta kill you all.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"HOPKINS","Boys! Down!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DJ","Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LEAD FBI AGENT","Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Who the hell are you??","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"LEAD FBI AGENT","Agent Fields, FBI!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FIELDS","Not anymore, you're not.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","But that's not fair!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"FIELDS","Is so! Is so!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"JENKINS","Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"GINO","That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","That's right.  I think we'll take a hundred percent now.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"JENKINS","Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"MURPHY","That's right.  Sometimes partnerships need to end.  Well, supercops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"HOPKINS","It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Thanks.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"DAWSON","I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","...I think I have a better idea.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"STAN","Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"KYLE","Certainly.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102
"CARTMAN","Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.","lil'-crime-stoppers",102

"AUDIENCE","Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!","red-man's-greed",103
"MANYMOONS","Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, ""I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?"" Coyote said to Pony, ""Why can you not yell yourself?"" And Pony replied, ""Because I am a little horse.""","red-man's-greed",103
"AUDIENCE","Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!","red-man's-greed",103

"RANDY","Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??","red-man's-greed",103
"RANDY","Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!","red-man's-greed",103
"RANDY","Where did you get that kind of money??","red-man's-greed",103
"BLACKJACK DEALER","Dealer, twenty one.  Sorry.","red-man's-greed",103

"MAYOR MCDANIELS","And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.","red-man's-greed",103
"RANDY","But how can they do that?!","red-man's-greed",103
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","The Native Americans have purchased the land from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.","red-man's-greed",103
"JIMBO","Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.","red-man's-greed",103
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","The Native Americans bought the bank.","red-man's-greed",103
"MR. GARRISON","Oh my God.","red-man's-greed",103
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.","red-man's-greed",103
"RANDY","No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves!","red-man's-greed",103

"STAN","We need somethng that'll get us money tomorrow!","red-man's-greed",103
"BUTTERS","Hey, I know! How about a dog parade?","red-man's-greed",103
"KYLE","Dog parade?","red-man's-greed",103
"BUTTERS","Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street. It'll be so adorable!","red-man's-greed",103
"KYLE","How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?","red-man's-greed",103
"BUTTERS","Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.","red-man's-greed",103
"STAN","Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!","red-man's-greed",103

"STAN","No!","red-man's-greed",103
"RANDY","Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.","red-man's-greed",103
"STAN","I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!","red-man's-greed",103
"KYLE","The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.","red-man's-greed",103
"STAN","Look, we, we've got nothing to lose.","red-man's-greed",103
"CHEF","What do you guys think?","red-man's-greed",103
"JIMBO","It's a long shot.","red-man's-greed",103

"CRAIG","Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CARTMAN","He's not our friend.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Stan?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"JASON","This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CRAIG","Take your non-flaming ass to some other school!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","No! Ah!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","I got beat up at school... for being different.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","No! For not being a metrosexual.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Gah! Just leave me alone!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"A VOICE","There you go! Now you look fabulous.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYAN","You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","GRRRRR!!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"THOM","Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","That does it! I know what I have to do!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Chef, can I talk to you?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Sure. Come on in.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. SLAVE","Oh Jethuth! Jethuth Chritht!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Well, what do you want me to do about it?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. SLAVE","How did you do that?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, ""I'm in the house"" instead of ""I'm here."" But then white people all started to say ""in the house"" so we switched it to ""in the hizzouse."" Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then ""in the hizzle"" which we had to change to ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" and now, because white people say ""hizzle fo shizzle,"" we have to say ""flippity floppity floop.""","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CHEF","Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"CLERK","You're going to New York alone?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CLERK","Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Kyle, what are you doing here?","south-park-is-gay!",104

"MR. GARRISON","What?? That's what I'm doing!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","I thoght of it first!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","No you didn't! No you didn't!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","Did so! Did so!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","I thought of it yesterday!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","I thought of it two days ago!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","I thought of it before you were born!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. SLAVE","Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.","south-park-is-gay!",104

"SHARON","You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"LINDA","I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MRS. TWEEK","I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"HEAD OF PROGRAMMING","Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"MR. GARRISON","Room service.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"HEAD OF PROGRAMMING","What? We didn't order any room service.","south-park-is-gay!",104

"STAN","Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can outdress you!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"RANDY","What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"TOM","Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"RANDY","Oh really?!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"TOM","You don't... like us being metrosexual?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"THE WOMEN","NO!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"THE MALES","Yeah!!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"LINDA","What?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"JIMBO","We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"SHARON","This is crazy!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"RANDY","Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"TOM","You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CRAIG","Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"CARTMAN","That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"RYAN","Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"STUART","We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"CARSON","Especially in those pants.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"JAI","Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYAN","Sorry Charlie, no sale.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"MR. GARRISON","Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all...","south-park-is-gay!",104
"THOM","You just had to push it, didn't you?!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"RANDY","I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!","south-park-is-gay!",104

"HEAD OF PROGRAMMING","Wha? What have you done?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"SHARON","We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"LINDA","That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"SARAH","We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.","south-park-is-gay!",104

"MR. GARRISON","So now, can you please change your network's programming?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"HEAD OF PROGRAMMING","Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.","south-park-is-gay!",104

"KYLE","What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?","south-park-is-gay!",104
"STAN","Yeah. It's cool, holmes.","south-park-is-gay!",104
"KYLE","...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You","south-park-is-gay!",104
"RANDY","Stan, are you okay?","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band.","christian-rock-hard",105
"RANDY","Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Heheheheheh heheheheheh.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(What? Is it?)","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","See what?","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTAMN","Our band should play Christian rock!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Christian rock?!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christiand will buy our crap!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","That's a retarded idea, Cartman!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","It worked for Creed!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genious!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","You're on, fat boy!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","What a stupid asshole!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Oh, hi Eric.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","...Ohhh!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle!  Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house!","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","What?! We don't have a bass guitar.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I told you, Token.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","So, what are we doing?","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially-windfalling experiences of our young lives.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Wow!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","We are going to start... a Christian rock band.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Awww.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","I'm out.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Still want to leave, Token?  Thank you.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Aaaargh!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Hey dude.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Really?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","You got a computer?","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","All right, cool.  Let's donwload some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","What the hell is that?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","I don't know.  Let me go check.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","I don't know!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them.  See? All we have to do is cross out words like ""baby"" and ""Darling"" and replace them with Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat.  Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","I don't know how to play bass.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line!","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","God-damnit!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","All right. Nice, fellas. Nice.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Well done!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Um, sir-","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","Shiut up!!  You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downlaoded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your couts on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica.  Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","What's the matter with him?","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it. Come. There's more.  Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free.  The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","That is the folly of man. Now look in this window.  Here you see the loving family of Master P.  Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","So, he's gonna get it, right?","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Almost there, you guys.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Ow...","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Wow, neato! An album cover!","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I'm going to kill you one day, Token.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","What did you say?!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Cheese!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","No no no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Cheese!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Oh...","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Token, look away to the right.  More. More!","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","Why the hell would I be looking way over there??","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! Our first album cover.","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Boy, I'll say!","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.","christian-rock-hard",105
"RANDY","Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.","christian-rock-hard",105
"DETECTIVE","Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(Yeah)","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Oh yeah.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","christian-rock-hard",105
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Oh hey guys. How's it going?","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","It is??","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walkng, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Tata!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KENNY","(Yeah.)","christian-rock-hard",105
"BIBLE VENDOR","Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's evern been produced, actually..","christian-rock-hard",105
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.","christian-rock-hard",105
"MC","All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003!  are you ready for some live music?","christian-rock-hard",105
"A MAN","Yeah Jesus!","christian-rock-hard",105
"MC","Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity!","christian-rock-hard",105
"TRINITY","The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Damnit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Who are you?","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Yeah, you guys are real hard core.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAGE HAND","All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.","christian-rock-hard",105

"FANS","Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!","christian-rock-hard",105
"MC","Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAGE HAND","That's Faith + 1.","christian-rock-hard",105
"MC","Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!","christian-rock-hard",105
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, ""Who the hell is MOOP?!"" Back to you, Tom.","christian-rock-hard",105

"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CEO","Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Heeheeheeyeah.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Yes, we sure do.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.","christian-rock-hard",105

"ANNOUNCER","With great inspirational songs like ""I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,"" """"","christian-rock-hard",105

"KYLE","You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!","christian-rock-hard",105

"STAN","Is this for real?? This is for real!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.","christian-rock-hard",105
"LARS","But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert.","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?!","christian-rock-hard",105

"TOKEN","Cartman, what the hell is all this?","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","But you spent all the money we made!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.","christian-rock-hard",105

"MICHAEL COLLINS","Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?","christian-rock-hard",105
"STAN","I thought albums win either gold or platinum.","christian-rock-hard",105
"MICHAEL COLLINS","Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!","christian-rock-hard",105
"KYLE","Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!","christian-rock-hard",105
"MICHAEL COLLINS","No, but you can go double myrrh.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","GOD DAMNIT!!","christian-rock-hard",105
"MICHAEL COLLINS","Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!","christian-rock-hard",105
"MICHAEL COLLINS","But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.","christian-rock-hard",105
"CARTMAN","OH, FUCK JESUS!!","christian-rock-hard",105
"BUTTERS","Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.","christian-rock-hard",105
"TOKEN","Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.","christian-rock-hard",105

"FATHER MAXI","Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly","grey-dawn",106
"FATHER MAXI","It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple ""man walks into a bar"" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again.","grey-dawn",106
"MR. GARRISON","Look out!!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY DRIVER","Huh? Was that a stop sign back there? Ooooh, I think I hit a pot hole.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","But they kill people.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","I'll be God-damned if they think they can take my license away!","grey-dawn",106
"SHARON","Oooh, hi Dad.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Yes Dad.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Yes I know.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!","grey-dawn",106
"MONA","No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way.","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!","grey-dawn",106
"MONA","Less miles means less gas, you old fool.","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","There's Country Kitchen right there!","grey-dawn",106
"MONA","Where?","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","Right there! You're gonna miss it!","grey-dawn",106
"MONA","Is this the parking lot?","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","I think so.","grey-dawn",106
"ANCHOR","Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer  were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom , who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!","grey-dawn",106
"SENIORS","Yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"SENIORS","Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about?  Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-","grey-dawn",106
"SENIORS","Yeah! Yeah! That's right!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!","grey-dawn",106
"SENIORS","Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","So now, what are we gonna do about it?","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the senior together a the community center and unite!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","...Oh, right, this is the meeting.","grey-dawn",106
"SENIORS","Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Sharon, have you seen Dad?","grey-dawn",106
"SHARON","He's not here, hun. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...","grey-dawn",106
"SHARON","Every senior in town will be driving home...","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","At the same time.  Oh My God!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets!","grey-dawn",106
"SOMEONE","Oh my Goddd!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Oh My God!!","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and paases the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS!","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","Dude, look!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","What is that?","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","I don't know.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","Dude, is that your dad?","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","I think so.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","-STREETS!! OFF-","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","What is he saying?","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","I can't understand him.","grey-dawn",106

"CARTMAN","Oh God, they're coming!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Get over there! Stay low!","grey-dawn",106

"RANDY","Quiet! Keep quiet!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Dad, I'm scared.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go.","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY DRIVER","How the hell did we get up here?","grey-dawn",106

"ELDERLY PASSENGER","I told you this was the wrong way!","grey-dawn",106
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage.","grey-dawn",106
"DMV OFFICIAL","Alrighty.  There we go. Next?","grey-dawn",106
"DMV OFFICIAL","We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please.  There we go.","grey-dawn",106

"DMV OFFICIAL","Well, we can certainly help you with that, too.","grey-dawn",106
"AN ELDERLY MAN","Yeah...","grey-dawn",106

"MARVIN","God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Okay, all set?","grey-dawn",106
"KENNY","(Oooooo my God!)","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Eh?  Go around. Go around, you moron!","grey-dawn",106
"BARBRADY","Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","I believe that's us... thank God.","grey-dawn",106
"BARBRADY","Could I see your license, please?","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","I ain't got one! You peckers took it!","grey-dawn",106
"BARBRADY","Well then, I have to take you to jail.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Stupid son of a- God damnit!","grey-dawn",106
"BARBRADY","I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Kiss my sagging ass!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","What's that?","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' descriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right!  And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!","grey-dawn",106
"MR. GARRISON","And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a ""Mongol,"" not to be confused with a ""mongoloid"" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what ...year ...the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...  That's odd.  Those ROTC guys are way off course.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","More old people!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","The American Association of Retired Persons.","grey-dawn",106
"MR. GARRISON","Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!","grey-dawn",106
"MR. GARRISON","Uh, can I help you folks find something? Oowww!","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Old people gone mad!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP MEMBER","Contact.  Put your hands up, young man!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","Marvin Marsh?","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Yes?","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades!","grey-dawn",106
"MALE NURSE","There now, Mr. Johnson.  We can go to the cafeteroa amd get you some creamed corn and toast.  Can I help you?","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","Help this!  The revolution is on, brother! We're taking control of the town!","grey-dawn",106
"MR. JOHNSON","Well, alright, well it's about damn time!  Hey everyone, we're taking the town.","grey-dawn",106
"AARP MEMBER","Seniors, we're taking the town over.","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","The revolution is on!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY WOMAN","The revolution?","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","Oh, I'd better get my other sweater.","grey-dawn",106
"A NURSE","Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?","grey-dawn",106
"MRS. WYLAND","Oh, I suppose so.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","What the hell is going on?!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP MEMBER","Shut your piehole and get over there!","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Dad, what are you doing??","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LEADER","That's right.","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","Yeah.","grey-dawn",106
"MAN IN VEST","Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Heh??  We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!","grey-dawn",106
"MAN IN VEST","Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Heh??  No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before morp people get hurt>","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.","grey-dawn",106
"AARP MEMBER","Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP LOOKOUT","We've got company!","grey-dawn",106
"TANK DRIVER","Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.","grey-dawn",106
"MRS. APPLEGATE","All right.","grey-dawn",106
"TANK DRIVER","What do you want?","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Heh??","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","We want our licenses back!","grey-dawn",106
"OTHER SENIORS","Yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY WOMAN","That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!","grey-dawn",106
"OTHER SENIORS","Yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!","grey-dawn",106
"OTHER SENIORS","Yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Hey Dad.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Stan! Boys! You're safe!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","They're saying something about taking over the entire country.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","No, son. We... like to sleep in.","grey-dawn",106
"AN ELDERLAY WOMAN","Two hostages come front and center!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","So our only solution is to cut off their life force.","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","We can't fight them, Cartman.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","Country Kitchen Buffet?","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","That's a retarded idea, Cartman!","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Yeah, I remember hearing about that.","grey-dawn",106
"KYLE","Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our triple goodbye to Kyle, and them we send him inside.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","All right!","grey-dawn",106
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Aw yeah!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","We did it!","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Well, right, or we could always do that.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!","grey-dawn",106
"AARP MEMBERS","All right!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Huh??  Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2!  What the heck?  Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","No...  Let us in! Let us in!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!","grey-dawn",106
"ELDERLY MAN","You have to let us in!","grey-dawn",106
"ARMY OFFICIAL","All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages. That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?","grey-dawn",106
"ARMY OFFICIAL","Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.","grey-dawn",106
"STEWART","Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?","grey-dawn",106
"SOLDIER","Sir, what should we do with this one?","grey-dawn",106
"ARMY OFFICIAL","It's up to the townspeople.","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!","grey-dawn",106
"RANDY","Huh?","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","That's right.","grey-dawn",106
"STAN","And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.","grey-dawn",106
"MARVIN","I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so","grey-dawn",106
"CARTMAN","Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.","casa-bonita",107
"KENNY","(Yeah.)","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Who's joking?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","You have AIDS?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Wow! Casa Bonita?!","casa-bonita",107
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","What's Casa Bonita?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","This Saturday! Awesone!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Who said I'm inviting you?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","You... your Mom said you could take three friends.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butthole?! Why?!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I have never been a dick to you.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE"," KYLE","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Okay, except maybe for that one time.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Sorry, my mind's made up.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my ball, asshole!! Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. Ah I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we we've moved past it.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!! Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Hi Kyle.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","That isn't it, Cartman.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","What isn't it?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","...I don't understand the difference.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I know you don't.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.","casa-bonita",107
"JIMMY","Well, sure, Eric. W-w-waht seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?","casa-bonita",107
"JIMMY","Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?","casa-bonita",107
"JIMMY","Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorius anti-d- ant'duhh ...antecdote.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Like what?","casa-bonita",107
"JIMMY","Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Who's there?","casa-bonita",107
"JIMMY","Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?""","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Wow, that's gonna be so fun!","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.","casa-bonita",107
"KENNY","(Yeah!)","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Hey Kyle.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Well?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well what?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Good.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","What's this all about, Eric?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Butters, can you keep a secret?","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Well, sure I can!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Nnn-how terrible?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","What??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. Do you see anything?","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","I just see stars.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer?","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","It is! It is getting clsoer! Oh my God!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","When do you think uh it'll get here?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","What??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his back yard! Come on, Butters! Hurry!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","AAAAHH!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh Jeez!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh God! Oh Jesus!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Are you sure?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I'm not sure of anythng anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh God, oh God!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Oh. Thanks, dude.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Hope you have a good one. See you later.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Oh wait. Cartman.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Yes?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","All right, let's go.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!","casa-bonita",107
"CHRIS","Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.","casa-bonita",107
"CHRIS","We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything.","casa-bonita",107
"LINDA","Oh Butters!","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Aw dude, weak.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. Well, let's get going, shall we?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Yeah, it's kinda weird.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Yeah.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there.","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Yeah. And then we can try the football field.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!","casa-bonita",107
"CAPTAIN","All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...""  Hello?  Hello??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Butters!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Hwaaaah!!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Wuh, wait, well, what happened??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","What about my parents. Did you see them?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh my God, let me see!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiatino level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.","casa-bonita",107
"FIELD REPORTER","Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.","casa-bonita",107
"CAPTAIN","All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita.","casa-bonita",107
"CAPTAIN","Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","What what what?","casa-bonita",107
"CAPTAIN","I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","UUuuugh!!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We'be gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Who's coming this way?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh God! I hate cannibals!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Noooo!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","But I can't see nothin'.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location.  There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Are we out in the destruction?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Aw man.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Huh... Oh, it's terrible.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Whoa!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Whaaat??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","AAAAHH!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Waaaaaah!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack?","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Ooohhhh!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh no!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Uh w-where??","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Look! There's an old refrigerator! Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Aren't you coming?","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains!","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool!  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothingn left. Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for readioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Really?","casa-bonita",107
"KYLE","Yeah, it's pretty cool.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.","casa-bonita",107
"STAN","Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.","casa-bonita",107
"CARTMAN","What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.","casa-bonita",107

"WORKER","No","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!","casa-bonita",107
"WORKER","Kid, what are you doin' here?","casa-bonita",107
"BUTTERS","I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.","casa-bonita",107

"STAN","The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","But that's just you and your friends.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHELLEY","I said shut up, turd!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","All right, that does it!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHARON","Where are you going?","all-about-the-mormons",108

"RANDY","Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Yeah.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MR. HARRISON","Hello!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MR. HARRISON","I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Uh, look, I just want to tell you that","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well, thanks. Uh...","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR","Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","With chocolate frosting","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR","Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","You know. About... God, and stuff.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well, I-","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well, no, no, I just-","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said ""Who the heck do these people think they are?!"" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Y-you can call me... Randy.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","To each his own, right?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","I found them! I found them!  You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"BUTLER","Found what?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"PEOPLE","What? What did he say? Are you crazy?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Maybe there isn't anything out here. Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow...","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing .","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MAN","Well, so where are they?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Where are what?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"WOMAN","The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb","all-about-the-mormons",108
"PEOPLE","Wow, amazing!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","He found the stones and golden plates","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","See? That's what happened to me!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHARON","What are you talking about?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","That's what they made me think, too!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KYLE","Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey Stan.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Wow, you made this?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh...","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Oh here comes my family now!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"THE HARRISONS","Hey you guys!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","Look, we painted our faces!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MARK","I'm a lion.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"JENNY","I'm an alien.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Oh my God...","all-about-the-mormons",108
"DAVE","You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MARK","We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Yeah. Have a good time, boys.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MARK","Let's go.  Our faces are painted.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KYLE","Wow!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","So what do you guys wanna do?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Eeheehee, Jesus Christ.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Sure.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Yeah, but... how?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MAN","What's this all about, Mr. Smith?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Well, sure I can.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","In America?  Really? That sounds kind of...","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","With these.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Rocks?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Really?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Wow!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. ""And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites.""","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","And that's how the Book of Mormon was written","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHELLEY","I wanna watch TV.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","And?  Your turn, Sharon.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Yes.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelley. Oooo, that must be the Harrisons!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey everybody.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MARK","Wow, what a great house!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KAREN","You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"JENNY","And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHELLEY","My brother is a stupid turd.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey Stan.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Hey Gary.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Dad!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"THE HARRISONS","Yeah! Woohoo!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Ooo, what's that?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Yeah.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Martin went home to his wife","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MRS. HARRIS","Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Lucy Harris smart smart smart","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Why would he make it up?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Martin Harris dumb dadumb-","all-about-the-mormons",108
"LUCY","All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Lucy Harris smart smart smart","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","He is??","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SMITH","Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SINGERS","Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"HARRIS","All right, Martin. Let's get to work!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","And that's how it happened.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KIDS","Yeah! All right!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"MARK","Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"SHELLEY","Me neither.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"RANDY","Yeah!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY SR.","Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KIDS","Yeah! All right!","all-about-the-mormons",108
"KYLE","Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Oh no! You guys broke up?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Hey Stan.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"STAN","Oh brother.","all-about-the-mormons",108
"CARTMAN","Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.","all-about-the-mormons",108

"STAN","I don't?","all-about-the-mormons",108
"GARY","Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life.","all-about-the-mormons",108

"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Come on in.","butt-out",109
"SHARON","Stanley, what did you do this time?!","butt-out",109
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!","butt-out",109
"SHARON","No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Mom...  Dad, it was just a-","butt-out",109
"RANDY","I don't have a son!","butt-out",109
"LIANE","Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Yeah. This is really their fault.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Yeah, huh?  Ih, it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!","butt-out",109
"LIANE","Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?","butt-out",109
"RANDY","Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Who's Rob Reiner?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it.  Apparently, people still don't understand hwo bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health?  Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings, they're the ones making music wanna smoke!  They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards!  This is war!!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Hwat??","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Yeah, what's the problem?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?","butt-out",109
"STAN","Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.","butt-out",109
"MR. GARRISON","Here he comes!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Damnit.  Butter!  Butter!","butt-out",109
"MR. GARRISON","What'd he say?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya!  These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, ""We fight fire with fire!"" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Oh no...","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","All right kids, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  Once you're nside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Got it!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","But... isn't that, kind of, lying?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Mm.  Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field.  The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back!  Oh my God!  Excuse me!","butt-out",109
"BUDS MAN","Yes?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Would you mind putting that death stick out?!","butt-out",109
"BUDS MAN","But, uh, this is a bar.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?","butt-out",109
"BARTENDER","Not in Colorado","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?!","butt-out",109
"BUDS MAN","Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii!","butt-out",109
"BUDS MAN","I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Isn't he awesome, you guys?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","What??","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  As soon as we get into the mani facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds!","butt-out",109
"RECEPTIONIST","Can I help you?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour.","butt-out",109
"EXECUTIVE","Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","Well, come on in.  How about a little history first?  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Not if I were around, they wouldn't have.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","Escuse me?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Oh, nothing! Please continue.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","So, tobacco helped to build America.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965, when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","That sound perfectly reasonable.","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","And here's our factory at work.","butt-out",109
"FACTORY WORKERS","With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay","butt-out",109
"YOUNG WORKER","I like to have a cigarehette every now and then","butt-out",109
"OLDER WORKER","And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty I don't care","butt-out",109
"FACTORY WORKERS","So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","Well, I guess that's the end of our tour.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture. Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now!","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","What??","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner! And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape!  Don't you try and stop us!","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","Oh my God!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Hoh boy, that was great, kids.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","This is how we get rid of smokers. We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work.  Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands!  And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","But dude, you're making stuff up.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!","butt-out",109
"WORKER","Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?!","butt-out",109
"WORKER","Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!","butt-out",109
"CATMAN","Wow, a commercial?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Guys, I thnk we shold bail out of this right now!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Huh?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it, it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.","butt-out",109
"KENNY","(Well yep, that's what I think.)","butt-out",109
"STAN","Yeah, maybe you're right.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commecial, gentlemen. The game... is on.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the comemrcial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha-","butt-out",109
"KYLE","What are you doing?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.Wait, this isn't my house.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the TelePrompTer here.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Heh, ho-okay.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?","butt-out",109
"SCARY ASSISTANT","That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.","butt-out",109
"SCARY ASSISTANT","But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","I'm not eating the cupcake.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. Youc an be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Jesus Christ! HAAAA!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Hey!","butt-out",109
"STAN","What are you doing, Cartman?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","They're going to kill me!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Who's going to kill you?","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Well, get away from us then.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Yeah dude, don't get us killed too.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","You guys have to help me!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","No dude, get away!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","If I go, you guys go!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Daaaad!","butt-out",109
"RANDY","What?","butt-out",109
"STAN","Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.","butt-out",109
"RANDY","Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies.","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us!","butt-out",109
"STAN","Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.","butt-out",109
"KENNY","(Uh huh.)","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heah! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Oh all right.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Why?","butt-out",109
"KYLE","Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!","butt-out",109
"STAN","So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","God-damnit!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Give us the child!","butt-out",109
"KEVIN HARRIS","We will not!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business!","butt-out",109
"TOWNSPEOPLE","Yeah! Yeah, that's right!","butt-out",109
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Wait a minute, what?","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it!","butt-out",109
"RANDY","Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.","butt-out",109
"STAN","Yup.","butt-out",109
"KYLE","You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","GOD-DAMNIT THERE'LL BE NO MORE SMOKING!!","butt-out",109
"STAN","It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!","butt-out",109
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","You're right, boys, m'kay?","butt-out",109
"BUDS MAN","Yeah. Let smokers smoke.","butt-out",109
"TOWNSPEOPLE","Yeah!!","butt-out",109
"MR. GARRISON","Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!","butt-out",109
"CARTMAN","I don't idolize you anymore, asshole!","butt-out",109
"ROB REINER","My goo! My precious goo!","butt-out",109
"KYLE","No.","butt-out",109
"STAN","All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","Right. What are we playing again?","raisins",110
"STAN","Football.","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","Got it.","raisins",110
"STAN","Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut!","raisins",110
"BEBE","Wendy breaks up.","raisins",110
"STAN","What?","raisins",110
"BEBE","Wendy breaks up with you.","raisins",110
"STAN","Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.","raisins",110
"BEBE","She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends.","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!","raisins",110
"BEBE","Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Oh yeah? Huwell, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","Yeh-heah, right!","raisins",110
"BEBE","God, you're so stupid!","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","What a whore!","raisins",110
"KYLE","Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan?","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","Come on, Stan, it's first down still.","raisins",110
"STAN","Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?","raisins",110
"KYLE","Why?","raisins",110
"STAN","'Cause I need to know why she broke up.","raisins",110
"KYLE","Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.","raisins",110
"STAN","Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?","raisins",110
"KYLE","God damnit!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up.","raisins",110
"WENDY","Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.","raisins",110
"KYLE","'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.","raisins",110
"STAN","What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.","raisins",110
"KYLE","No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic.","raisins",110
"STAN","Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!","raisins",110
"JIMMY","Hey Stan.","raisins",110
"STAN","Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?","raisins",110
"JIMMY","For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?","raisins",110

"STAN","Well?","raisins",110
"JIMMY","She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over.","raisins",110
"STAN","Over?  Jesus...","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","We came over to cheer you up, Stan!","raisins",110
"STAN","...Go away.","raisins",110
"KYLE","Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.","raisins",110
"STAN","Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?","raisins",110
"CARTMAN","God, what a fag!","raisins",110
"KYLE","Dude, not now!","raisins",110
"STAN","You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...","raisins",110

"STAN","Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?","raisins",110

"STAN","Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.","raisins",110
"GOTH GIRL","My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.","raisins",110
"LITTLE GOTH","They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders.","raisins",110

"MERCEDES","Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.","raisins",110
"FERRARI","Okay.","raisins",110
"MERCEDES","First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey, cudie."" When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys.""","raisins",110
"FERRARI","Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.","raisins",110
"MERCEDES","Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!","raisins",110
"PORSCHE","Okay!","raisins",110

"LEXUS","Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie. So how are you, honey?","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?","raisins",110
"LEXUS","Good, good.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.","raisins",110
"LEXUS","Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.","raisins",110
"LEXUS","Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.","raisins",110

"LINDA","Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.","raisins",110
"STEPHEN","Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Okay.","raisins",110
"STEPHEN","You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.","raisins",110

"WAITRESS","Damnit, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?!","raisins",110

"STAN","Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul.","raisins",110
"KYLE","God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!","raisins",110
"STAN","So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.","raisins",110
"KYLE","Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!","raisins",110
"KYLE","Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!","raisins",110
"STAN","What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?","raisins",110
"KYLE","Yeah. She is.","raisins",110
"STAN","Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?","raisins",110
"HENRIETTA","For sure.","raisins",110
"KYLE","Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.","raisins",110

"RAISINS GIRL","Hey cutie, you having a good time?","raisins",110
"BOY","Yeah.","raisins",110
"STEPHEN","Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.","raisins",110
"LINDA","This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.","raisins",110
"PORSCHE","Hi guys. Can I take your order?","raisins",110
"LINDA","Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.","raisins",110
"PORSCHE","I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?","raisins",110
"LINDA","No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.","raisins",110
"PORSCHE","I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.","raisins",110

"STEPHEN","Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.","raisins",110
"LINDA","Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Huh?","raisins",110
"STEPHEN","You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!","raisins",110
"LEXUS","What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?","raisins",110
"LEXUS","I'm sorry, sweetie.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","So that's it? We're broken up now?","raisins",110
"LEXUS","I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.","raisins",110
"GOTH VOICE","Look at this. Another tortured soul. Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check it out.","raisins",110

"BUTTERS","Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.","raisins",110
"HENRIETTA","Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Yeah.  It sure does hurt.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.","raisins",110
"STAN","Huh? But you just got dumped","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, ih ih, ih it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...","raisins",110
"STAN","No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.","raisins",110
"BUTTERS","Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan.","raisins",110
"STAN","He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.","raisins",110

"ELISE","Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son! Peter, it's Mommy.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111
"HARRY","It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111
"ELISE","So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111
"ELISE","I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111
"HARRY","We want to take Peter home, to Canada.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111
"HARRY","Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.","it's-christmas-in-canada",111

"HARRY","We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!","it's-christmas-in-canada",111

"BUTTERS","Wowee! Hey, can I play, uhninjas with you?","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Yes, and no time to do it. No time...","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","I think I'd make a really good ninja. Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh they just shun me all the time.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-","good-times-with-weapons",112
"LINDA","Hi Butters.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive supervillain of all time! Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"LINDA","Oooh, Butters, are you going out to play again?","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Yeah Mom, I'm jus' goin' outside for a little while.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"LINDA","Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Well, okay-okay Mom.  Bah! Gah!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Goddamnit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","No asshole! From now on you only get to have ONE power! So what is it?!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","I have the power to have all the powers I want.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","That doesn't count, fatass!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","C'mon!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Haaa hahahaha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Who the hell is that??","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","I dunno. Craig, is that you?","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Fools!  I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom!  Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Whoa.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.","good-times-with-weapons",112

"STAN","Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Nuh uh!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Yeah huh, I got you!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a ...titanium alloy that shields me from heat!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchakus Sokuromoto!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Hahahahaha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","All right! And now I will use my power to...  turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Goddamnit Cartman!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Hahahahahaaa ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Enough! Uh I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KENNY","(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!) (Feel my wrath!)","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Oh, fuck dude!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","It's Butters. Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KENNY","(I just threw it like Stan asked me.)","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","It hurts! It hurts!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Oh man! We are in serious trouble!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Ssh sshhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.","good-times-with-weapons",112

"STAN","Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Guys, meeting over here for a second? All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Dude, shut up!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","I agree with Cartman!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","What??","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","Just stay still, Butters.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Hwa.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","God-damnit!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Whoa, I'm getting woozy.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait what about the veterinarian?","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Dr. Shafley?","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","He's really old and and goin blind.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","So if we make Butters up to look like a dog,...","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","Ohh no.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","We might pass him off as our pet.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Ohoo but, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I I'm gonna get grounded.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"KYLE","That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?? Butters needs medical attention right now!!","good-times-with-weapons",112
"STAN","All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","I need the modeling glue. We need more fur over here.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"BUTTERS","Uh that modeling glue is making me dizzy.","good-times-with-weapons",112
"CARTMAN","Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!","good-times-with-weapons",112

"ANNOUNCER","In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped , and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.","good-times-with-weapons",112

"LIANE","...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No.","up-the-down-steroid",113
"CARTMAN","All right, Mom, look. Here's ...the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes, ...if I could just see the challenges they face every day, ...mauye I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?","up-the-down-steroid",113

"CARTMAN","Go on, Kyle.","up-the-down-steroid",113
"KYLE","I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!","up-the-down-steroid",113
"CARTMAN","Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-","up-the-down-steroid",113
"KYLE","I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!","up-the-down-steroid",113

The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p...p...pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy-""  ""-steroid-taking jackass.""

"CARTMAN","You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"JACK","Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"CARTMAN","Ah hello everyone. Achtung.  My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club.  Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"CARTMAN","But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"ELISE","Wha, what does that mean, sweetie?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"JACK","I'm not sure, but-uh.  Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"CARTMAN","Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"GUESTS","Heheh great! Yeah! Great idea.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"CARTMAN","Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"SHLOMO","We sure do!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"GUESTS","Yeah. All right. Woohoo!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"KENNY","(Hello)","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"STAN","Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"MEL","You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"STAN","Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"MEL","Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first.  But I won't tell you where I keep my money.  You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"STAN","Tor-torture you?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"MEL","Ha! So you DO intend to torture me, huh?!  Well go ahead! Do your worst! You STILL won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"STAN","We don't want to torture you.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"MEL","I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"STAN","Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"MEL","I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo!  Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"MEL","How dare you call me crazy! This means war!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"FR. MAXI","And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"FR. MAXI","...What is troubling you, my child?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it ...so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"FR. MAXI","Ah! You mean he's a Jew!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"FR. MAXI","Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","But how can the Jews make it better??","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"FR. MAXI","Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about... atonement.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"SHLOMO","What a great idea!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"CARTMAN","And as we march for The Pasion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit fü¾˜¶˜¼r sauberen,"" you all chant back ""Wir mü¾˜¶˜¼ssen die Juden ausrotten.""","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"ELISE","Well, what does that mean, dear?","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"JACK","Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"SHLOMO","Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"TOWNSFOLK","Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"RABBI","Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congragation.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"KYLE","I saw The Passion.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114
"RABBI","Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.","the-passion-of-the-jew",114

"KYLE","Yeah.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","All right. Now, where did you get served?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight.  I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"RANDY","What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it??","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"SHARON","That was the right thing to do.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","Naw, that's crap, Sharon! Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"STAN","But Dad-","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","Now!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan. ...six, seven, eight.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"KYLE","Dude, that is a sweet RC car.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"SHARON","Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"SHARON","Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","So what happened?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"SHARON","It's on!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"DR. DOCTOR","He got served. Worst I've ever seen.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"JIMBO","Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","Oh Lord...","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","His dancing was so fast I ...couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive.  Ungh! Grrgh.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"NURSE","Shh relax, Mr. Marsh.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"DR. DOCTOR","We just got the X-rays back.  He mostly got served here  and here . But the worst serving was here in the pelvic region. The road to recovery will be a long one.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"JIMBO","Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh Stan?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"SKEETER","Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","I, I don't know. He seems all right.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MR. GARRISON","I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to outdance those OC bastards!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","Stan?? Stan??","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Yeahh I'm I'm right here, Dad.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"STAN","Okay, good.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANDY","But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","God damnit!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Hey guys. Uh. You guys know how to dance, right?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","Of course we know how to dance.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RED GOTH","Dance troupe? Please.  We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school.  Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","Yeah.  The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RED GOTH","No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RED GOTH","I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"HENRIETTA","Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"LITTLE GOTH","I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Great!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"HENRIETTA","Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RED GOTH","Yeah. We just got Goth-served.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","We should go to the arcade.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","The arcade?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Dude, he's incredible.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Yeah.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","That's stupid.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Dude, we need you.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","I can't dance without the machine.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","Okay. I'll give it a shot.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","All right, that's three!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","Dude, we need a girl.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Huh?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"TALL GOTH","We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Oh yeah.  Wait a minute. I know just where to go!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"PORSCHE","Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MAURY","You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","So you'll do it?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","Why not?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","All right, we just need one more person!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","I think his name was...  Leopold... Stotch or something?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"LINDA","Butters, you have some visitors.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"STAN","Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Wow, neato, a competiton? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"MERCEDES","A tragedy?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Waaaaah!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"YAO","That don't look like a dancing duck to me.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANCHER","Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Ih ih Is that the only song he'll dance to?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"RANCHER","No no, he'll dance to anything. See?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"LINDA","Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay.  Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Two years ago. Two years ago!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"ANNOUNCER","That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it!  All right, and now, dancing to the song ""I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You,"" here is Colorado state champion, Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"SINGER","I've got something in my front pocket for you","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Whoops.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"WOMAN","Paul. Paul!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be.  I think we should-  Whoa.  This... is the dance troupe?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","Oh boy.  All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BOOMBOX","You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","Oh Lord have mercy.  Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. Nono, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart.  Nono, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","What? I don't wanna get served.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","What do you want?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. I gave that up.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Yeah well, you tell that to their families.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","I let those people down! Don't you get it man?! Eight people died!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Oh what?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","HAAAA!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","But that isn't the point, Butters! The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Leggos until you're an old man.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Get out of my room, Stan!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Fine.  But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MC","Yeah, make some noise!  Ladies and Gentlemen, man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"LIL KIM","What's up, niggaz?!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MC","This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew! And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"JIMBO","Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MR. GARRISON","Aww yeah.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

"STAN","What?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","What happened??","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MERCEDES","He was practicing the say takedown and slipped on the floor.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"YAO","Can he move it?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Aw, what do we do, Chef??","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"OC LEADER","They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"STAN","Butters!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CHEF","All right!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MC","All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"CD","Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"BUTTERS","Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MC","Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead. That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"SKEETER","Woo!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115
"MR. GARRISON","Yeah!","you-got-f'd-in-the-a",115

A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11th.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Whoa...","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","You... you're my robot?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Yes. I will be your new best friend.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Oh wow!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already. Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In face, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey yeah! Well I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a heziated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Could be.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school.  You okay, AWESOM-O?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to ...put up my rectom.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Oh, really?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Heh. Wow, that sucks.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","What?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! Hi sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","You saw that?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Nuh uh.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","No way.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll lhave my revenge, boy howdy!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","How come?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Oh, son of a bitch!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Ohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.","awesom-o",116
"CHRIS","Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Ah, Buttters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O does not have a mom.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yup! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away!","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Aww, that's just adorable.","awesom-o",116

"BUTTERS","I like to brush my teeth in the morning and at night. The teeth won't mind ..","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Oh. Yeah.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository. Can you help me?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","What?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","...No way.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Weak!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeyeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Lame!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Where is it? Where is it??","awesom-o",116

"BUTTERS","Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better! Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.","awesom-o",116

"BUTTERS","Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together. Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I would like some Sunny Delight too.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uheehee.  Whoa. Uh go answer the door, AWESOM-O.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O will answers the door.","awesom-o",116
"KYLE","What the hell are you doing, fatass?","awesom-o",116
"STAN","Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.","awesom-o",116
"STAN","Why?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?","awesom-o",116
"STAN","Why?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Ah, hey fellas! Ah I see you met my robot.","awesom-o",116

"CARTMAN","Suck mah balls, Kyle.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","He's made in Japan!","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.","awesom-o",116
"LIANE","Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.","awesom-o",116
"LIANE","Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Excuse me, I didn't catch that.","awesom-o",116
"LIANE","Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.","awesom-o",116
"LINDA","Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.","awesom-o",116

"BUTTERS","Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever!","awesom-o",116

"AUNT NELLIE","Didn't ya bring any bags?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.","awesom-o",116
"AUNT NELLIE","Your robot?","awesom-o",116
"UNCLE","Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie.","awesom-o",116
"AUNT NELLIE","Hello! It's nice to have you here.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?","awesom-o",116
"AUNT NELLIE","Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Thank you.","awesom-o",116
"UNCLE","I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.","awesom-o",116
"AUNT NELLIE","Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.","awesom-o",116
"AUNT NELLIE","Right...","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","AWESOM-O?","awesom-o",116

"BUTTERS","I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neato, huh?","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","We're really smart.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family.  Hey, what's that over there?","awesom-o",116
"WOMAN","Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.","awesom-o",116
"GIRL","What's he do?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Superbowl next year?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","The New Orleans Saints.","awesom-o",116
"BOY","Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Seventeen.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas!","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Exactly!","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000.  I've already seen what he can do.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","It's not?","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","Oh, very nice, Mitch.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a ...golden retriever, or something.","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","Yeah yeah!","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","Yeah, we wanna hear it!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a ...boxer, or something.","awesom-o",116
"MITCH","Punch-Drunk Billionaire!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Haaaa! Haaaa!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Ye, you okay AWESOM-O?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this:  The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler.","awesom-o",116
"BLACK OFFICIAL","That's incredible!","awesom-o",116
"WHITE OFFICIAL","You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could reprogram it and turn it into a weapon!.","awesom-o",116
"BLACK OFFICIAL","Yes, that might be the best thing to do.","awesom-o",116
"WHITE OFFICIAL","Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...","awesom-o",116
"BLACK OFFICIAL","Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.","awesom-o",116
"WHITE OFFICIAL","But worse. With robots.","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","I I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub.  Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles!  I want that robot!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.  You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a ...pleasure model?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","...What?","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","AWESOM-O does not understand.","awesom-o",116
"PRODUCER","Let me show you what I mean.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","LAME!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","NOT COOL! TOTALLY LAME!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Waaaaa!","awesom-o",116
"SOLDIER","Let's go! Move, move!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Are those arm and leg locks secure?","awesom-o",116
"SOLDIER","Secure, sir!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","What the hell?","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","What's going on?","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","It... powered itself back on.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Ah, I'm sorry, robot,  they want me to reprogram you.","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","What did you say?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I said I'm a real person, asswipe!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","...Oh my God.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","What's happening?","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","What? How can that be?","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Goddamnit, get me down from here!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Who made you, robot?!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I'm not a robot, I'm a human!","awesom-o",116
"WHITE OFFICIAL","Jesus, the scientist was right.","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country,  Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Damn you all to hell!..","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!","awesom-o",116
"SOLDIER","It'll all be over soon, robot!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","What the hell are you doing?!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTIST","Well I, I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am!","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","AWESOM-O!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","I am the AWESOM-O 4000.","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","No!!  No, please!  Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world!","awesom-o",116
"SCIENTSIT","There. You see? You want to tell me this isn't humanity? Who's to judge what makes somethng human anyway?! Does this make me human?!  Or this?! Or these?!","awesom-o",116
"GENERAL","Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all-  Heh- wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?","awesom-o",116
"BUTTERS","Hey, robots don't fart!","awesom-o",116
"CARTMAN","Uh... now ending fart sequence.","awesom-o",116

"BLANKET","Wait, don't you guys wanna come inside and play?","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","Huh look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on, guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels.","the-jeffersons",117

"CARTMAN","He is MY friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm serisouslih! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!","the-jeffersons",117
"RANDY","Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","D'huh?","the-jeffersons",117
"CHRIS","I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doodoo in their soul.","the-jeffersons",117
"OFFICER","Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","Whatcha got?","the-jeffersons",117
"OFFICER","Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","So, what's the problem?","the-jeffersons",117
"OFFICER","Take a look. Says here...  He's black.","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.  Let's go people! We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!","the-jeffersons",117

"SERGEANT","Why is it that us policement around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?","the-jeffersons",117
"HARRIS","Oh why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.","the-jeffersons",117
"RANDY","Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.","the-jeffersons",117
"RANDY","Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.  Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars.","the-jeffersons",117
"RANDY","Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting.","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends.","the-jeffersons",117
"SHARON","Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat hairy balls!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Come on, Blanket!","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","Hey Harris Harris Harris! Harris!","the-jeffersons",117
"HARRIS","What what what?","the-jeffersons",117
"SERGEANT","It's Jefferson! He's back!  All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.  Whoa, wait a minute!  That guy isn't black!  Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus!  This is Yeats! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!  You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!","the-jeffersons",117
"HARRIS","It says right here on the final sheet he is!","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Does that look like a black guy to you?!","the-jeffersons",117
"HARRIS","It said on the final sheet!","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!  Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.  Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?","the-jeffersons",117
"HARRIS","Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","To hell with you!! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I KNOW he's black for sure!!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","That poor kid.","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Hi guys!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Really? You mean it?","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Mr. Jefferson, ih it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? Wee, look! He can fly!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Jesus Christ, dude!","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Aaaaaah!!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Stop, you fucking lunatic!!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.  Jeekabee durtah!  Ow!  There, Blanket, shhhh. Hey, hey look, hey look.  I got your nose.  Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Aaaaaaaa!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","No, Blanket, stop!  It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!","the-jeffersons",117
"WOMAN","Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.","the-jeffersons",117
"MAGGIE","Quitting the force? You?","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","None of it makes sense anymore.  I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?? And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm jast damn tired.","the-jeffersons",117
"MAGGIE","Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yeats.  Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wipin' that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrsion Yeats. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself.","the-jeffersons",117
"MAGGIE","Where're you goin'?","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Think I've got a little more work to do.","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!  I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!  But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!  Oh, I'm melting!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","Yeah, sure, whatever.","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","Aren't I too big to be Blanket?","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Blanket, you in here?","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Hi guys!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay?","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","You are? Oh thank you thank you thank you!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","All right dude, get in his bed.","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","All right, but you guys owe me for this.","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something.","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Hello, this is Sergeant Yeats over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from yoru area. One Martin Jefferson?","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Well, he doesn't really look that black.","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Yeah, I don't uh... Hold on a second. There was oine we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","We uhhh found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Molestation, nice.","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with doodie feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.","the-jeffersons",117
"SNETZL","Heh yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","Mr. Jefferson, hello??","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","What are you doing with my Blanket? Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Go go RUUN!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Sutah!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Oh Jesus!","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","What the hell is going on, you guys?","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket!","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Wee, he can fly! He can fly!","the-jeffersons",117
"KENNY","Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Oh my God, they killed Kenny!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","You bastard!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Blanket? Blanket! Come play!","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Nooo!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Come on!","the-jeffersons",117
"STAN","Run Blanket Run!","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Ah!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","Hang on, Blanket!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","It's ignorant.","the-jeffersons",117
"CARTMAN","Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!","the-jeffersons",117
"MR. JEFFERSON","You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh.  Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.","the-jeffersons",117
"BLANKET","Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.","the-jeffersons",117
"YEATS","Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.","the-jeffersons",117
"KYLE","All right! Things just might work out!","the-jeffersons",117
"WOMAN","Yes?","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?","goobacks",118
"WOMAN","Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!","goobacks",118
"WOMAN","How about fifteen dollars?","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?","goobacks",118
"KYLE","You've been on your fucking phone since we started!","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Dude, I'm takin' a break.","goobacks",118
"KYLE","A break from what?! You haven't done anything!","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.","goobacks",118
"KYLE","All you ever do is talk about your balls!","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?","goobacks",118
"KYLE","If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!","goobacks",118
"STAN","Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?","goobacks",118
"WOMAN","Oh goodness, what happened?","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","Shoveling accident.","goobacks",118
"WOMAN","Oooh no, come on inside.  Wait right here, I'll be right back.","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I'd totally let you have it.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.","goobacks",118
"NEWS ANNOUNCER","This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Whoa.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Christina Naylon has more.","goobacks",118
"CHRISTINA NAYLON","The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?","goobacks",118
"BRAD MORGAN","Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Now, uh he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh to find a job here.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?","goobacks",118
"BRAD MORGAN","Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi-his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundres of dollars, but uh enough, he says, to feed his family.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?","goobacks",118
"HARRISON MOORE","Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!","goobacks",118
"RANDY","We know, Stanley. We've been watching.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.","goobacks",118
"HARRISON MOORE","Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived!  It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family.","goobacks",118
"SHARON","There you go. All set, sweetie?","goobacks",118
"STAN","Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.","goobacks",118
"SHARON","I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep.  You've had a busy day.  Goodnight, sweetie.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?","goobacks",118
"MRS. LANDIS","Ooo, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.","goobacks",118
"CARTMAN","What?? Who??","goobacks",118
"MRS. LANDIS","One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.","goobacks",118
"KYLE","Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.","goobacks",118
"STAN","All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house.","goobacks",118
"KYLE","Dude.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Son of a bitch!","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?","goobacks",118
"CHRIS HOLT","Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. Eh it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this:  Back to you, Aaron.","goobacks",118
"AARON BROWN","Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America.","goobacks",118
"OTHER MEN","They took your jobs!","goobacks",118
"STAN","It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!!","goobacks",118
"OTHER MEN","They took yer jobs!!","goobacks",118
"SHARON","Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?","goobacks",118
"STAN","I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh-","goobacks",118
"SHARON","Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner?","goobacks",118
"STAN","Who is that?","goobacks",118
"RANDY","That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!","goobacks",118
"SHARON","What??","goobacks",118
"RANDY","Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!","goobacks",118
"SHARON","Who taught you to talk like that?!","goobacks",118
"STAN","Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.","goobacks",118
"RANDY","They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.","goobacks",118
"STAN","I wanted my job!","goobacks",118
"RANDY","Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!","goobacks",118
"SHARON","That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.","goobacks",118
"STAN","Timecist?","goobacks",118
"SHARON","You know, a racist, but against people from the-","goobacks",118
"STAN","People from the future. Right, got it.","goobacks",118
"RANDY","All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.","goobacks",118
"ANNOUNCER","And now, here is Bill O'- Reilly.","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","Thanks for having me, Bill.","goobacks",118
"DOUCHE","Hello.","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! They took our jobs!","goobacks",118
"SKYNARD MAN","They took our jobs!","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","Those jobs belong to people from the present!","goobacks",118
"DOUCHE","Heh it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","They took our jobs!","goobacks",118
"SKYNARD MAN","They took our jobs!","goobacks",118
"STOUT MAN","Too-kourderb!","goobacks",118
"MR. GARRISON","All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.","goobacks",118
"KYLE","What?!","goobacks",118
"MR. GARRISON","So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as ""The boy threw the red ball,"" which in Futurespeak of course, is  Everyone say it with me?  Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as  ""The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late."" Or in Futurespeak, ""Vvut.""","goobacks",118
"THE KIDS","""Vvut.""","goobacks",118
"KYLE","Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!","goobacks",118
"CRAIG","Yeah!","goobacks",118
"STAN","That's right!","goobacks",118
"DOUCHE","Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do.","goobacks",118
"MR. GARRISON","Thank you, aging hippie liberal douche.","goobacks",118
"DOUCHE","You betcha.","goobacks",118
"TIMMY","Timmih.","goobacks",118
"MR. GARRISON","Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this?  ""The sad girl puts balls in her mouth."" Or, in Futurespeak of course, ""Gluch gligh balls glych gligh.""","goobacks",118
"MAN A","This is bullcrap!","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman.  ""Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane.""","goobacks",118
"MAN B","What? That's ridiculous!","goobacks",118
"MAN C","They can't do that!","goobacks",118
"MAN D","That was a good idea!","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?","goobacks",118
"CHET","How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and and it ushers in a new ice age?","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!","goobacks",118
"CHET","Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?","goobacks",118
"DARRYL WEATHERS","Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?","goobacks",118
"CHET","Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.","goobacks",118

Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better.","goobacks",118

"BALDING MAN","I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come.  We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do.  We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry.  This is my wife, Janice.  The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries.","douche-and-turd",119

"JIM LEHRER","Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche  and a turd sandwich  We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people?","douche-and-turd",119
"GIANT DOUCHE","Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.","douche-and-turd",119
"CARTMAN","Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! It's an obvious suck-up move.","douche-and-turd",119
"GIANT DOUCHE","But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","You're a turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"GIANT DOUCHE","... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","You're a turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"GIANT DOUCHE","... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","You're a turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"JIM LEHRER","Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn.","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","I I'm sorry, Jim.","douche-and-turd",119
"GIANT DOUCHE","Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I I forgot what I was saying.","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","Ha. Wha-hat a douche.","douche-and-turd",119
"JIM LEHRER","All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.","douche-and-turd",119
"TURD SANDWICH","... Uh you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it.  He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzzer sound.","douche-and-turd",119
"JIM LEHRER","Your time is up, Turd.","douche-and-turd",119
"BALDING MAN","Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa.  She seems to have taken a liking to you.  And she's ovulating.","douche-and-turd",119

"BALDING MAN","Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.","douche-and-turd",119
"STAN","I do love animals, just ...nnot like you guys do.","douche-and-turd",119
"BALDING MAN","You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.","douche-and-turd",119
"STAN","I can't. I was banished for not voting.","douche-and-turd",119
"BALDING MAN","But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?","douche-and-turd",119
"STAN","I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.","douche-and-turd",119
"BALDING MAN","But Stan, don't you know, it's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.","douche-and-turd",119
"STAN","I guess... I guess you're right.","douche-and-turd",119

"CARTMAN","Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working for the Wall*Mart to stup you from succeeding!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Goddamn that took a long time.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","I did not! I wanna close Wall*Mart just as much as you guys do!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RECEPTIONIST","Can I help you?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall*Mart in our town.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RECEPTIONIST","Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall*Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","We want to talk to who's in charge.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RECEPTIONIST","In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall*Mart. One of the original creators.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Where's he?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","We... invented the Wall*Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low.  We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","So how do we stop it?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","You don't stop it.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","There has to be a way!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall*Mart in your town! ...Unless...of course, you can find and destroy its heart.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","The heart of Wall*Mart?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","Every Wall*Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","You speak too much, sir!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","Because the Wall*Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall*Mart and now? They are Wall*Mart shoppers all.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","All right. Come on you guys, we have to get back home.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"HARVEY BROWN","It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall*Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?? WHAT DID WE DO??  Boys!  Tell the world... Im sorry!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","No, dude, don't!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","That's ten bucks you owe me, dickface!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","All right, this is it! If Wall*Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall*Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall*Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall*Mart all along!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","I knew you were!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","No you didn't.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yes I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","No you didn't.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yes I did!!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","No you didn't.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yes I did!!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","No you didn't.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yes I did!!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","No you didn't.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Yes I did!!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","... You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","I can't hear you! Lalalalalala!  I'm sorry, boys. but if you want to hurt the Wall*Mart, you'll have to go through me!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CARTMAN","Very well, Kenny! Let us battle!  No, Kenny. Kenny! Knock it off.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"GRANDPA MARSH","Welcome to Wall*Mart.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Save it, Grandpa!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","We've gotta find the television department.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall*Mart.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Shhhhh! What are you talking about?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","What?!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall*Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Gaaahh! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","I think I see the television department in the back!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Is that the right way, Dad? Dad??  Dad!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","The screwdrivier set is only nine ninety-eight!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Come on, Dad!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","No, dad! We need your keys!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on!  The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","There! The television department!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"MAN","Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Who are you?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"MAN","I am... Wall*Mart.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","You?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Where's the heart?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Mr. I'm asking the question.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","The question is, ""Where is the heart?""","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","It's a mirror.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","We'd better get out of here.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CHEF","Get out! It's gonna blow!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Hey, come on! We've gotta get out!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120

"KYLE","The Wall*Mart is exploding! Everybody out now!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"MR. GARRISON","Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall*Mart!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","All Wall*Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"CHEF","We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns!","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall*Mart... is us.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"KYLE","Duh.","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"RANDY","You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?","something-wallmart-this-way-comes",120
"STAN","Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Okay, hang on a second I-","preschool",121

"WARDEN","Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned. One Crayole eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue.

"TRENT","Can you give me back my time? Huh? Can you do that?? Kindergarten, first grade, second? Can you give me that??","preschool",121
"BUTTERS","Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.","preschool",121

"LINDA","Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him.","preschool",121
"CHRIS","What happened to him, Doctor?","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one.  It also appears like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.","preschool",121
"LINDA","What's that?","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.","preschool",121
"LINDA","If only we had let him in!  Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help??","preschool",121
"CHRIS","Now, honey, we were trying to read.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!","preschool",121
"KYLE","That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!","preschool",121
"STAN","Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, heh.","preschool",121
"STAN","I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Dude, we shouldn't be here!","preschool",121
"STAN","Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.","preschool",121
"STAN","We've come to... ask you for help.","preschool",121
"KYLE","We need you to protect us... from a bully.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deloxe hamburger at Red Robin. All this can be yours.","preschool",121
"KYLE","Well...  Well, what do you want?","preschool",121
"STAN","Yeah.","preschool",121

"TRENT","Thank you, ma'am.","preschool",121
"STAN","You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.","preschool",121
"STAN","But mom, my teacher will-","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""","preschool",121
"STAN","But Mo-o-o-","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","""But Mo-o-o-om.""","preschool",121
"STAN","This is hopeless!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?","preschool",121
"STAN","That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!","preschool",121
"KENNY","(I'll do it.)","preschool",121
"STAN","No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.","preschool",121
"KYLE","What else has big round squishy globes?","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.","preschool",121
"KYLE","No, the nipples are more in the middle, see?","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.","preschool",121
"KYLE","How do you know?!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!","preschool",121
"STAN","All right, fine.","preschool",121
"KYLE","Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.","preschool",121
"KENNY","(Oh yeah!)","preschool",121
"KYLE","God I hope this works.","preschool",121
"STAN","Escuse me!","preschool",121
"STAN","We, we got it.","preschool",121
"SIXTH GRADERS","Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","All right!","preschool",121
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!","preschool",121
"KENNY","(All right!)","preschool",121
"STAN","Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?","preschool",121
"KYLE","Naw.","preschool",121
"KYLE","Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.","preschool",121
"STAN","Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? Ms. Claridge?","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Hwuh?!","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life!  Get a cold towel on that pink belly!","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","Over there!  Another wet willie?","preschool",121
"SIXTH GRADER","It's all","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","Give the poor kid some morphine.","preschool",121
"STAN","Dude, what happened?","preschool",121
"KYLE","Oh, Jesus. You told him that?!","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl","preschool",121
"STAN","What's that?","preschool",121
"DR. DOCTOR","It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus.  I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side.","preschool",121
"STAN","We're dead. Trent knows we send the sixth-graders after him.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls.","preschool",121
"KYLE","We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!","preschool",121
"STAN","No, no, we've just gotta find better help.","preschool",121
"KYLE","From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.","preschool",121
"STAN","There is... one person.","preschool",121
"STAN","Shelley?","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!","preschool",121
"STAN","Shelley, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!","preschool",121
"STAN","Shelley  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left.","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","STOP CRYING, TURD!! Now, who's gonna kill you?","preschool",121
"STAN","Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","Oh, you are such stupid turds.","preschool",121
"STAN","We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.","preschool",121
"KYLE","So you're gonna help us?","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","A picture of your mom's boobs?","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","SHUT UP, TURD! You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!","preschool",121
"STAN","Admit it was our fault?","preschool",121
"SHELLEY","You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd.","preschool",121
"STAN","Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-someting to tell you.","preschool",121
"KYLE","The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","A lot of stupid things that we regret.","preschool",121
"KENNY","(And it's time for us to come clean.)","preschool",121
"STAN","See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our weiners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fierman.""","preschool",121
"TRENT","I've been lookin' for you!  Firve years I've been waitin' for this day.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","AAAAAAAAH!","preschool",121
"STAN","Trent, look: We've realized our mistake!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Yes, our conscious got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth.","preschool",121
"TRENT","You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you!","preschool",121
"TRENT","Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there WERE no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I didn't get to fight a huge mechanized Barbra Streisand like you did! No accidental trips to Afghanistan for Trent Boyett!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Stay away from us, Trent!","preschool",121
"STAN","What is that?","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!","preschool",121
"TRENT","Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","I am NOT going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!","preschool",121
"TRENT","You don't even know how to use that! Wow!","preschool",121
"TRENT","No! They did it!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.","preschool",121
"TRENT","Naw! You've gotta listen to me!","preschool",121
"KYLE","Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","Whatever, that's like five years from now.","preschool",121
"STAN","Yeah, who cares?","preschool",121
"THE BOYS","Yeah, woohoo","preschool",121
"CARTMAN","We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa!","preschool",121

"STAN","Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now that's traditionally a uh, a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots, and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih ih turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Will do.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","More snow for South P... p-p Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.","quest-for-ratings",122

"CARTMAN","All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Boy, that was a GREAT episode!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MAN","Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show?","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","What??","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","For God's sake, Mr. M-m-Meryl?","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","How many students is that?","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Four.  Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","...Craig's show??","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","What is that butthole doing now?!","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","O-hoh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CLYDE","Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than yoru show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh sorry, kids.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team them, very much.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Withot it, we have nothing.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","...You're gay!!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Hey look, Craig just walked in.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KEVIN","Hey, Craig, over here!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Geez, and all that from a stupid video show.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CRAIG","Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Go play with yourself, Craig.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CRAIG","Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Your idea took about this much thought, Craig!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CRAIG","This much more than you had!  Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KENNY","(Woohoo!)","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole??","quest-for-ratings",122
"KENNY","(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that?! We've always been supercool to you!  Ah whatever, Kenny!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CRAIG","Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle close-up animals.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CLYDE","Put it, put it up on the, monitors!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KIDS","Cuuute.  Super cuuute.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Gah, I just don't get it.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Wow, those animals are pretty cute.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, he'll let us stay on the air!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Well, what are we waitin' for?!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Come on, guys!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","It should be Sexy News.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Action News.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Hey, yeah. Uhwhy I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Gosh, Butters, write that down!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Lie about celebrities.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","And panda bears for the preschoolers.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Good!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Oh boy!","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Fellas, are you sure all of this ie eh- ethical?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","We're in fourth grade, Timmy. We don't even know what ethical means.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Sexy Action School News Team, ho!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I, I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Huh?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.","quest-for-ratings",122
"ANNOUNCER","This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now, Time for the Sexy Action School News!!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!","quest-for-ratings",122
"RAISINS GIRLS","Woohoo! Woohoo!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.","quest-for-ratings",122
"RAISINS GIRLS","Woowoo!!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the jinx on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","One testicle!  What an asshole!","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Uh oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity scene shot, with Butters.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr... travesty.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're goin' to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Then let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmark Monday.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","But this is real news!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","It's boring news, Jimmy.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","How do you know?? You you haven't s-seen it yet!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","All right, tell me about it.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","We're making the news more appealing to students.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibliltiy to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting?","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!","quest-for-ratings",122
"THE BOYS","All right! Woohoo! Awesome!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","I knew we could do it!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","We beat Close-up Animals!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Oh man, this is sooo great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you!","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Craig's new show?","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look.  That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He like... an idea machine.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. MERYL","Yes.  And I guess your best wasn't good enough .","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","I don't believe it.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Stupid news hair!","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","What if we do a show where we go to- Uh, no.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","How about we have us, um... hmmm.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Well how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us.","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","We did that!","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do a show with us... ughhh.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Thee... uhhh. What if the-?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Crab people?","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Hey, I know! We should read the funnies! I always get good ideas from the funnies.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, a-and the other snail says ""Well that's gonna add another hour to his time."" Yeah! You guys!  Heh.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","How about we do a show where we kill Butters?","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","So Dagwood says ""Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house.""","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","We have crab people. Just sayin'.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!","quest-for-ratings",122
"TOKEN","Cough medicine?","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","How do we know which one to use?","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAB","How about this one? Calminex?  ""Warning: Taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects.""","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","That sounds perfect.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","B-b-bbingo!","quest-for-ratings",122
"PHARMACIST","Can I help you boys?","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.","quest-for-ratings",122
"PHARMACIST","Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","It's not?","quest-for-ratings",122
"PHARMACIST","No! What you want is Calminex PM.  It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Oh, okay.","quest-for-ratings",122
"PHARMACIST","Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls.","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","Wha, what do you think, fellas?","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","I guess we'll just take all of 'em.","quest-for-ratings",122
"PHARMACIST","That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission. Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. SLAVE","Oh, Jezuth Christh","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Woo. We aren't havin' a party.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. GARRISON","Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right?  Us too.","quest-for-ratings",122
"MR. SLAVE","Jezuth.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all think and g-gooey.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?","quest-for-ratings",122
"JIMMY","I think maybe he's f-feeling it.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Stan, are you getting good ideas?","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog.","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Oh Stan, I just got the best idea","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Me too.","quest-for-ratings",122
"BUTTERS","Hey! Let's run naked through the street!","quest-for-ratings",122
"CARTMAN","Dude, this TV show is awesome.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","It's... 's the greatest show of all time.","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","I could watch this for days.","quest-for-ratings",122
"THE BOYS","Cuuute. Super cuuute.","quest-for-ratings",122
"STAN","You guys. You guys, wake up!","quest-for-ratings",122
"KYLE","Ah!","quest-for-ratings",122

"KYLE","Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.","cartman's-incredible-gift",124

"KENNY","(Don't take it personally, Kyle)","cartman's-incredible-gift",124
"KYLE","I AM taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.","cartman's-incredible-gift",124

"LIGHT CUB","Yeah. An abortion. That can work.","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"MEDIUM CUB","But, we don't know how to give abortions.","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"DARK CUB","Do you know some place we can learn, mister?","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"NARRATOR","""Where can they learn that?"" the boy said with a frown.","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"STAN","What?!","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"NARRATOR","So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"STAN","No, he didn't.","woodland-critter-christmas",125

"STAN","I don't know, I, I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it'd ridiculous.","woodland-critter-christmas",125
"DOCTOR","Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!","woodland-critter-christmas",125

"MR. GARRISON","God bless you, Doctor. I know you'll make me well again.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Now, you're absolutely sure you want a vaginoplasty?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","All right, then let's begin.  Just relax, Mr. Garrison. I think if more people could just see a sex-change operation, they would know how perfectly natural it is. The first thing I'm going to do is slice your balls.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","Ough, ergh. Eww.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","With the scrotum open, I can now discard of your testicles.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","So long, balls.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Now, I'll just continue the incision up the shaft of the penis.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","Oh, that stings.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Now I'll just... turn your... penis inside out.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","OH! Oh jeez.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","All we need to do now is ...stuff the ...unskinned penis inside your... pelvis... And now I'll use the skin from your penis to make vaginal lips.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. GARRISON","Do I look like a woman?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Pretty much.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"STAN","Dude, don't be nervous.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"STAN","You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126

"COACH","Yeah. Uh, look, kid, you've got great skills and a great attitude. But you're just not physically ...built for the game.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Oo whataya mean?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"COACH","Well, it's just that... Jew's can't play basketball.  Awwright, kids, we've gotta work on that shooting! Come on!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126

"MRS. GARRISON","Hi gals!  Oh boy, can you believe the sales they're havin' out there? Well, I'm about to pee out my vagina for the first time.  Give us a hug. Girls' Club! Oh wow! This is great! Look at that, I'm peeing sittin' down like a dainty dignified little woman!  Sany, any of you ladies wanna go see a sad movie together?  You guys try those new wings tampons? Do those work well?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"STAN","Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Hello, boys! It's me, your teacher! Mrs. Garrison!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"CARTMAN","You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","I had a sex-chamge operation. My penis is now a vagina and I'm experiencing womanhood for the first time in my life! See ya in class!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"IKE","Penis!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"IKE","Vagina!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Yeah. That's right.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Totally! I totally understand!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","So, I hear you're interested in reconstructive surgery.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Oh yes, Mr. Garrison. Uh yes, he had a vaginoplasty. Mhm.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Sure. You see sometimes a woman wants to be a man. That procedure is called a peniplasty.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","No, no, uh I wanna be tall and black.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","...You what?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Ohhhhh! You want a negroplasty!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Yeah!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"STAN","Wha-a-a negroplasty??","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","It's a fairly common procedure, really, just the reverse of a caucasioplasty just like Michael Jackson had. Let's take a look here.  What we do is slice your face and peel it back so we can insert now pig-ment producing cells inside.  We break the arm bones in several places and put braces to make them longer. Now, the knees we need to snap off and fill with small round objects that can cause better movement.  And we finish it off with a nice peniplasty to enhance the genitalia.  Negroplasty takes about seven hours and costs roughly three thousand dollars.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"STAN","Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Well, it's a good idea if you wanna be tall and black. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Hello, Mr. Slave.  Boy have I been busy. A woman's work is never done.  I got some tampons. I should be getting my period really soon. I hope I don't get too emotional and drive you crazy with my PMS.  Mr. Slave, I got somethin' for us, too.  Would you like to take this beautiful woman to bed?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","No thanks.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Nu- no thanks? Come on, Mr. Slave, I wanna try out my new snootch.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","I can't believe you just went ahead and had that surgery without even asking me what I thought.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Well, I ASSUMED you supported me. It's still me; I just have a vagina instead of a penis.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","But I'm gay! I don't like vaginas!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Don't you even care that I was suffering? I wasn't happy the way I was!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","It's great that you feel better, but you never stopped to think about how other people around you would feel!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Look, we can still be together. All you have to do is stop being gay!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","How can you say that?! You're gay too!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","I'm not gay! I'm a woman!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MR. SLAVE","Oh, Jezuth Christh!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Oh, so is that it?!  You're just gonna walk out?! You men are all alike! Go ahead and find somebody who doesn't have a vagina, you fag!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Dr. Biber said he can give me a negroplasty so I can finally look the way I've always wanted. He even took my picture and then did computer imaging to show what I would look like after the surgery.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","But Jews can't play basketball!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"KYLE","I'm never speaking to either of you ever again!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Dr. Biber.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Oh, you're Kyle's father.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","What is that on your shirt?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Ahhh you like dolphins, hm?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","I can make you one.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","Invert the back, move the esophagus to the top of the head. Yes, a full dolphinoplasty could be achieved relatively simply...","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"SINGER","If I could swim with the dolphins, the soft and gentle dolphins...","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DR. BIBER","There's nothing crazy about a person wanting to look on the outside the way they feel on ths inside.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"ANNOUNCER","It's Girls Gone Wild!  These gilrs will do anything!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126

"MRS. GARRISON","Oh boy, men will do just about anything to get a look at our tits, won't they? Men are all the same. My boyfriend walked out on me! Turns out he was a fag. But I've been livin' it up ever since, havin' sex with all kinds of different guys! Girl power!  You know, the strange thing is, I haven't gotten my period yet. Is there a reason a woman might miss her period?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"REDHEAD","Well, normally, if a woman misses her period, it means she's pregnant.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","...Pregnant?  Oh my God. Of course. I haven't gotten to experience a period because... one of those truckers I slept with got me knocked up.  I'm pregnant, everybody! Hoh boy, now I can have an abortion!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126

"NURSE","Mrs... Garrison?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Oh, that's me.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Hello doctor, looks like I need an abortion.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","...an abortion?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Yeah, I've got one growing inside me. Now, are you gonna scramble its brains or just vacuum it out?  ...If you want you can just scramble it and I'll queef it out myself.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","Mmister Garrison-","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Mrs. Garrison.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","Mmrs. Garrison, you can't have an abortion.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","Don't you tell me what I can and can't do with my body!  A woman has a right to choose!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","No, I mean you're physically unable to have an abortion, because you can't get pergnant.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","But I missed my period.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","You can't have periods either.  You had a sex change, Mr. Garrison, but you don't have ovaries or a womb. You don't produce eggs.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","You mean, I'll never know what it feels like to have a baby growing inside me and then scramble its brains and vacuum it out?","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","N-that's right.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","But I paid five thousand dollars to be a woman. This would mean I I'm not really a woman. Ih, I'm just a... a I'm just a guy with a mutilated penis!","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"DOCTOR","Basically, yes.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126
"MRS. GARRISON","...Oh boy, do I feel like a jackass.","mr-garrison's-fancy-new-vagina",126

"ELDERLY WOMAN","Hippies?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am. See that? Hippies.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Oh my.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Yep, that's what I thought. See that? You've got a drum circle in your backyard.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Oh, well they showed up a few days ago, but I didn't think they were hurting anything.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson county. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Oh dear.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"ELDERLY WOMAN","Oh, well, so, so what do I do?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymerethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  Goddamnit!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Goddamn hippie!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Get out of here!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-cricle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!","die-hippie,-die!",127

"CARTMAN","The college know-it-all hippies.","die-hippie,-die!",127

"KYLE","Hey, let's ask them.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?","die-hippie,-die!",127

"KYLE","Wha- whataya mean?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","Who are the corporations?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","Are you serious?? We never heard that.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","We just spent our first semester at college. Our professors opened our eyes. The government is using its corporate ties to make you sell magazines so they can get rich.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"KYLE","Ugh! Those dirty liars!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"KENNY","(Sonofabitch!)","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","Well... Well what do we do?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","Just hang with us for a bit. We'll fill you in on everything you haven't been told.","die-hippie,-die!",127

"SHARON","Stan, sweetie, we're gonna go to the mall. Do you wanna come?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","Mom, the mall is a way for the corporate fatcats to imprison you into a life of servitude. I've got some stuff you should read.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"SHARON","Okay, sweetie.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","All right, people, we can move onto issue number 14B.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CHEF","Mayor, we have got to do somethin' about all these potholes on our roads!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"LINDA STOTCH","We don't have it in the budget to fix them right now.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CHEF","We-","die-hippie,-die!",127
"GUARD","You can't go in there!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Please, I have to talk to you all right now!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Kid, we're have a city council meeting.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Mayor, something very big is happening, and if you all don't give me a moment of your time, there may be no more South Park to council over!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"RANDY","What are you talking about?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town. At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this... Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They'er thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"LINDA","A what?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Ti's, it's simple science. Look: When hippies start to nest in a new area, it draws other hippies in. With the right weather conditions and topography, it can lead to a music festival. One that last for days, even weeks. Reggae on the River, Woodstock, Burning Man, they will all pale in comparison to what we're looking at now. In my professional opinion... I think we're looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which we've never seen.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Kid, what the hell are you talking about?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"COUNSELOR MACKEY","Uh, Eric, we're, we're talkin' about potholes right now, m'kay.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","Johnson, get him out of here.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","What are you doing?!  You have to listen to me! You can't sweep this problem under the rug!  The town is in serious danger!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","You see, the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","Right, so how do we get back at them?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"KYLE","Yeah, we're pissed off.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","Well, so my idea was this: Let's have like a weeklong music festival, draw everyone here, and then together, we can tear it all down.  Whoa, what the hell?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"KYLE","Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"STAN","NO!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been comprimised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Everybody get in a single-file line!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"OFFICER BARBRADY","There you are!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.","die-hippie,-die!",127

"OFFICER BARBRADY","Oh no, you're coming downtown!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","Who was that?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","What did I do?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"OFFICER BARBRADY","You can't kidnap people and lock them in your basement.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","They're not people, they're HIPPIES!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS.","Is this problem under control?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"OFFICER BARBRADY","I handled it, Mayor. Gee whiz.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","I know. I signed the permit.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","You... You what?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","I signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here. Their little ""festival"" should pump some money into our economy.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","They're hippies! They don't HAVE any money! Does the city council know about this?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","They don't have to know. I can sign whatever permit I want!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN!  That kid really needs some psychiatric help.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"OFFICER BARBRADY","Yeah.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"MAYOR MCDANIELS","All right, let's go.","die-hippie,-die!",127

"CARTMAN","Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"RANDY","It's yours.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"PRINCIPAL VICTORIA","Fine.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"JIMBO","Anything else?","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"CARTMAN","All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?!","die-hippie,-die!",127
"DRIVER","Wow, this band is so crunchy. Dude, I need more weed.","die-hippie,-die!",127

"CARTMAN","In less than three days, all of South Park will be completely consumed. My only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd, and reach the heart, here.  If we can reach the stage, we can upload this Slayer CD into their music system.  Hippies can't stand death metal. If everything works, they should disperse just before they consume us all.","die-hippie,-die!",127
"JIMBO","Nice plan, kid, except there's one giant flaw. That hippie crowd is massive! How the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage?","die-hippie,-die!",127

"MRS. GARRISON","Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.","wing",128

"KYLE","How come we never get opportunities like that?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","You wanna know what it is, guys?","wing",128
"KYLE","We're not talented?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.","wing",128
"STAN","Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.","wing",128
"KYLE","Probably.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!","wing",128
"STAN","Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.","wing",128
"STAN","He's looking at the sign.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Perfect! All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.","wing",128
"STAN","All right.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.","wing",128
"KYLE","Why?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.","wing",128
"STAN","It's genius.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested. Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!","wing",128
"TOKEN","Nothin'","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.","wing",128
"TOKEN","Yeah.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.","wing",128
"TOKEN","I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","This will only take a second.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token. Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.","wing",128
"STAN","Oohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself: You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency? Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?","wing",128
"TOKEN","...Yeah?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Token, the truth is that without representation, you in danger of being taken advantage of.  Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.  Super Awesome Talent Agency. Oh yes, hello! How are you, Abraham Lincoln?  Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln. I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.","wing",128

"CARTMAN","Jew!","wing",128
"STAN","You guys, we're gonna lose our client.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?","wing",128
"TOKEN","We were at why I should give you ten percent.","wing",128
"STAN","Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.","wing",128

"PRODUCER","He'll pay her four thousand dollars.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Four thousand dollars??","wing",128
"PRODUCER","Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp. And don't be late.","wing",128
"STAN","We won't!","wing",128
"STAN","You guys, you guys!","wing",128
"KYLE","What?","wing",128
"STAN","Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!","wing",128
"KENNY","(What?!)","wing",128
"KYLE","Get out!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","That's four hundred for us! We did it!","wing",128
"KYLE","Woohoo! Yeah!","wing",128
"STAN","Yeah!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Who let the dogs out?","wing",128
"THE BOYS","Who? Who? Who who?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Who let the dogs out?","wing",128
"THE BOYS","Who? Who? Who who?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Who let-?","wing",128
"STAN","Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?","wing",128
"KYLE","What do you mean? We thought she was with you.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Naw, sh-she was with you!","wing",128
"STAN","...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Wing? Wing??","wing",128
"KYLE","Wing?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Wing? Here, Wing!","wing",128
"KYLE","Wing?","wing",128
"KENNY","(Wing?)","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","You thought you could run from us, did you?","wing",128
"STAN","Oh no!  Hey! That's our client!","wing",128
"KYLE","They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away. Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves. It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.","wing",128
"STAN","Two four nine all right, this is the place.","wing",128
"KYLE","Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Of course it's impressive! They steal everyone else's clients!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Yeah, whatever. You can suck our balls.","wing",128
"STAN","Hello? We want to talk to somebody right now!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain.","wing",128
"KYLE","You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!","wing",128
"STAN","You tell 'em, Kyle!","wing",128
"KYLE","You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!","wing",128
"STAN","Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","What the hell is that?! Go! Go!","wing",128
"KYLE","Dude, maybe we should give up!","wing",128
"STAN","No! Screw that, dude! If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rouch, we can play rought too!","wing",128
"KYLE","Cartman!","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this!","wing",128
"STAN","We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way!","wing",128
"KYLE","Wing??","wing",128
"KYLE","Stupid talent agents!","wing",128
"KYLE","All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny? Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!","wing",128
"KYLE","They killed Kenny!","wing",128
"STAN","You bastards!","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","Enough!  I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here. But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!","wing",128
"STAN","Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","This woman has a contract with us! We own her!","wing",128
"KYLE","She had a contract with us first! We own her!","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","Her life belongs to us!","wing",128
"KYLE","Her life belongs to us!","wing",128
"STAN","Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.","wing",128
"KYLE","Yeah.","wing",128
"STAN","Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","Perhaps... you're right. We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.","wing",128
"KYLE","Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","I am tired of this business. It is a very dirty and perverse business.","wing",128
"STAN","It's a lousy business. I quit.","wing",128
"KYLE","Me too.","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Aw aw guys, come on!","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","We quit too.  It's time for us to find another way to make money. From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.","wing",128
"PRODUCER","Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding. And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of... Wing!","wing",128
"WING","Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long...","wing",128
"MR. KIM","Boys, thank you so much for eveything. You rearry helped us out.","wing",128
"TONG LEADER","Yes, you were right, kids. Her voice is so beautiful.  To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.","wing",128
"STAN","I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.","wing",128
"TOKEN","Send a cress in your plates, folks?","wing",128
"KYLE","Token?","wing",128
"TOKEN","Oh... Hey guys.  What, what are you doin' here?","wing",128
"CARTMAN","Token, you're... waiting tables?","wing",128
"TOKEN","Yeah. Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.  I'm trying to work my way back home.","wing",128
"LIANE","Oh, Poopie-kins, it's very early.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one! Come on!","best-friends-forever",129
"LIANE","Sweetie, can't we go after school?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Kenny, when did you get here?","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(Friday)","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here.","best-friends-forever",129
"TALL GOTH","Hey dickhole! What do you think you're doing?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.","best-friends-forever",129
"SIXTH GRADER","There's no saving place, fourthie! Get to the back or we'll beat your face in!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Oh, Goddamnit!  They'd better not sell out!","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Wuh what'd I do?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","JUST SHUT YOUR JEW MOUTH!","best-friends-forever",129
"GAME VOICE","""Congratulations! You have reached ...lever nine!""","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Kenny? Kenny, are you still playin' with that thing?  Kenny, it's been two weeks and you've done nothin' else!","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(I could get to level sixty!)","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Who cares if you almost made it to lever sixty?! You're wastin' your life, Kenny! If you died tomorrow, what would you have to show for it?! You'er gonna end up wishin' you'd done more with your life, just like your dead-beat father!","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","Hey, I heard that, bitch!","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","I wasn't talkin' to you, asshole!!","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","How about I come in there and kick your teeth in!","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","I'd like to see you try!","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","Goddamnit, do you have to smart off at me in my own house?!","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","It's my house too, you no-good loser!","best-friends-forever",129
"GAME VOICE","You have reached level sixty!","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached lever s-!)","best-friends-forever",129
"DRIVER","Oh yeah, lever four, sweet!","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!)","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","Welcome to the Kingdom of Heaven, Kenny. I am Peter.","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(What the fuck is going on?)","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","There isn't much time, Kenny. You're dead, but, your death was no accident. Heaven needs you.","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(Me??)","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","Come! There is much to discuss.  Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massiva attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven.  But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(That I what??)","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan. You... are the best. YOU, are the only hope for the universe.","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","He beat Satan's army in over three thousand separate simulations.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","The child did something none of us could: Reach lever sixty on the PSP. Now I don't know if that's luck or perseverence, but it's Goddamned impressive. All right, Kenny, let me show you what we're up against.  This is the Kingdom of Heaven. Satan's armies will attack the gate ...here. They are... ten billion in number. Maybe more.  Our armies are here, here, and here. Just under... ten thousand strong.  We are outnumbered and in need of someone who can singlehandedly bring the whole Dark Empire down. Basically, Kenny, you... are Keanu Reeves.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","My fellow damned souls! Now is the time for our assault!  You know no fear! You will drink the blood of angels! We go now! Nothing can stop us!","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","My spy!","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","Impossible! How?!","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","Oh Jesus Christ.","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","My Lord. My Lord, we must attack, now!","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","What's the point?! They have a Keanu Reeves now.","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","Do not fear, my Lord. Your army is great!","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","Very well.  Demon Army, begin your march on Heaven!","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","Up here, you get the best tactical view to protect the fortress. It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.","best-friends-forever",129
"KENNY","(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","This golden PSP is king of all PSPs.","best-friends-forever",129
"ANGELS","Hail the holy PSP.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","It works just like the ones we sent to Earth. All the commands you make will be sent to the troops down on the battlefield. All you have to do is play the game, Kenny. Only this time, It's for reals.","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Hell's army is departing! They head now for the Gates of Heaven.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","Prepare the troops!  We must be ready for them!  The time is at hand, Kenny. The stage is set and the final battle between Heaven and Hell is about to begin! The fate of the outcome is in your hands.  Where'd he go?","best-friends-forever",129
"FEMALE NURSE","Doctor! Doctor, we have a pulse!","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","Then that's it! We brought him back.","best-friends-forever",129
"MALE NURSE","Amazing, doctor! You've revived somebody who's been legally dead for almost a day!","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","Call the parents. They're going to be shocked to find out... their son is alive.","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","It's the latest in electro-plastilical science. Your son's organs are all functioning again.","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","It's a miracle... Kenny, you're alive.","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","I'm a-fraid he can't respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny's brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a ""persistant meditative staute.""","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Will he ever recover?","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","I'm afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaied once dead. But his soul is still in here.  Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It's just that, now, he's more like ...a tomato.","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","He can't more on hiw own-ah how will he eat?","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","A feeding tube. It pumps a nutrient paste directly into Kenny's stomache. With it we can actually keep Kenny the tomato alive for years.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","A feeding tube?!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Yes. Apparently they're using machines to keep them alive.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","But... that's not natural. God intended Kenny to die! What are these people doing?!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","And Satan's armies are approaching.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","Oh God-damnit","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","Boys I want to thank you for coming down to my office on such short notice.","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Are we in trouble or something?","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","No. Boys, I'm a laywer. Your friend Kenny has passed away and I've called you here to read his will.","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Kenny had a will?","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","In the highly liekly event of my death, I, Kenny McCormick, wish to leave all my belongings to my good friends, Stan and Kyle. Dudes, you were the friends a guy could have.","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Oh wow...","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","That's... really touching.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Fag!","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","To Eric Cartman: Eric, I never really liked you. But then, nobody does. You have no ability to feel, and you are going to die alone and miserable. It is only because I feel so sorry for you that I leave you my Sony PSP.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","There is one more thing I would like to ask you all, as my friends. If I should ever be in a vegetative state and kept alive on life-support, please,...","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Please what?","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","I don't know. I lost the last page.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?","best-friends-forever",129
"LAWYER","It's right here, along with Kenny's other belongings. They're all yours.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Yes!","best-friends-forever",129
"MAN","He's alive!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","What?","best-friends-forever",129
"MAN","Kenny McCormick! He's alive at the hospital!","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Oh my God!","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","Your army nears the Kingdon of Heaven, my Lord.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","I don't know if we should continue without knowing more about this Keanu Reeves God has.","best-friends-forever",129
"SPY ANGEL","Satan! I come bearing good news! The Keanu Reeves boy has been revived on Earth! His soul is no longer in Heaven.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAB","Then God is helping us.  Full march, to the Gates of Heaven! Victory is ours!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Kenny??","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Kenny! You're alive!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Dude, how's you do that??","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","He can't responde to you, boys. Being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain,","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Well... well then he's NOT alive.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","He's alive. He-ee smiles when I talk to him. I think...","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look. Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","I I don't know if it's right to keep Kenny alive on that machine. I I just... I don't know what he would want.","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCOMRICK","He did? When?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Um, it was um, this one time...","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Stupid? PSP is stupid?!  Did you all hear that??  Uh I mean, I mean this isn't about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes. And Kenny said he didn't want to live like this!","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","He did not!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Did so!","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Did not!","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court!","best-friends-forever",129
"PETER","Satan's army has crossed over the Plains of Limbo!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Then they will be here on the morrow. Without Kenny's soul here there will be nobody who can use the holy PSP.","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","No! There is another. A Japanese boy did make it to level fifty-nine.","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","Are you stupid, Uriel? Japanese people don't have souls!","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","Oh, right right, I'm sorry","best-friends-forever",129
"MICHAEL","Kenny remains our only hope! Here is what we must do.  Gabriel and Uriel, you go down to Earth and try to get that feeding tube removed. In the meantime we will put all our troops at Heaven's Gate. We will try to keep Hell's Aermy from breaking through as long as possible. Hopefull, it will be long enough to get our Keanu Reeves back.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.","best-friends-forever",129
"CHIEF JUSTICE","Well I'm sorry, young man, but the parents want their child kept alive. I don't believe you have any legal authority here.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look. Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","Look, Kenny, your friends are here to visit you again.","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","But this just doesn't seem right.","best-friends-forever",129
"STUART","Wha, what's the matter, doctor?","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","I'm afraid I've been given a court order to remove Kenny's feeding tube.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","What?","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","He's right in here.","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Cartman!","best-friends-forever",129
"CHIEF JUSTICE","Kenny's BFF says that Kenny didn't want to be kept alive artificially. The courts have determined we must obey his wish.","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!","best-friends-forever",129
"POLICE OFFICER","Sir, take a look at this.","best-friends-forever",129
"CHIEF JUSTICE","That's all the verification we need. Pull the feeding tube, doctor.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. MCCORMICK","No doctor! You can't!","best-friends-forever",129
"THE DOCTOR","I'm sorry. I have no choice.","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Here is the hospital","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","This is hopeless, Gabriel. We cannot interact with anything on Earth, how could we possibly get a feeding tube removed?","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","That dirty no-good sonofabitch!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he he's gonna die for sure!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","The tube has been removed?","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","Apparently, some blessed child has done our work for us.","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Good. Now all we must do is pray nobody interferes with the child's death a second time.","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Yeah!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","No!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Let's go to the, uh, media. We'll make everyone in the country know that they're killing Kenny.","best-friends-forever",129
"KYLE","Yeah, come on!","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","No! No, no boys! Aw Goddamnit!","best-friends-forever",129
"ANCHOR","This is HBC News. A right-to-die case debate is heating up in Colorado,  where Kenny McCormick's feeding tube has been removed by his BFF.  Two boys are bringing national attention to this story by protesting outside the hospital.","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Don't kill Kenny!","best-friends-forever",129
"ALL","You bastards!","best-friends-forever",129
"STAN","Don't kill Kenny!","best-friends-forever",129
"ALL","You bastards!","best-friends-forever",129
"URIEL","No! No, they're not killing him, they're letting him die!","best-friends-forever",129
"SKEETER","You bureaucrats have no right to play God and take that tube out!","best-friends-forever",129
"GABRIEL","Nono, see, they were playing God when they put the feeding tube IN!","best-friends-forever",129
"ANCHOR","A woman was arrested for trying to bring food to the patient.","best-friends-forever",129
"MRS. GARRISON","Get your man-hands off of me!","best-friends-forever",129
"ANCHOR","However, a growing number of people are also standing behind Kenny's BFF, Eric Cartman.","best-friends-forever",129
"CARTMAN","That's right. Respect our authoritih-m.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","What mockery is this?!","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","My Lord...","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","The feeding tube has been pulled! If the child dies and his soul returns to heaven, God will have his Keanu Reeves!","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","Perhaps the child won't die in time.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","Forget it! I'm calling the attack off!","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","No! Keep your army marching, my Lord. I will get that feeding tube put back in.","best-friends-forever",129
"SATAN","How?","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","I will do what we always do: Use the Republicans.","best-friends-forever",129
"GEORGE BUSH","We Republicans are deeply saddened by the tragic events in Colorado.","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","Removing the feeding tube is murder, hughughughughughugh...","best-friends-forever",129
"GEORGE BUSH","Removing the feeding tube is murder!","best-friends-forever",129
"HOODED FIGURE","Who are we to decide if Kenny should live or die?","best-friends-forever",129

"KYLE","The skin's the best part...","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Well, I gotta go home, guys. I'm gonna sit on the toilet and read comic books. See you at the bus stop tomorrow.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131

"STAN","All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KENNY","(Fuck yeah!)","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KYLE","That sounds great!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KYLE","Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131

Eh... Kenny. Kenny, you want fifty cents?  Dude, look at me, Kyle, I'm right here!  Wha...? How did...? Like they couldn't see or hear me. It's almost as if I were...  dead.

"BLACK PLUMBER","Hunh, I could think of a few ways, hunh.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LIANE","Ohoho, nhn.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","No! No!!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"FAT PLUMBER","What happened? Did they say?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"THIN PLUMBER","Apparently there was so much chicken skin in the system it just ruptured the insides.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"FAT PLUMBER","Aww, that's tragic.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131

"WOMAN","What is that kid doing?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"MAN","Ah I don't know, just ignore him.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, yuu've got some too-","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Hey Eric!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","...What did you say?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Huh I just said, ""Hey Eric!""","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters...  Butters! You can see me??","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well, sure I can see you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Oh my God, and you can hear me??","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Because, Butters, I'm... dead.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","HAAA!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","You died?? How??","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","But if you're d-dead, how come I can see you?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I don't know, but you're the only one who can.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","Butters, what on earth are you doing??","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","Dead people?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Who's seeing dead people?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Me! I saw a ghost!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Now, Butters, there's no such thing as ghosts.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Butters, these things happen all the time. You've got a very active little brain and your mind was just playing tricks on you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Ruh, really?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Yeess.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","That's right. There's no reason to be afraid of things that aren't real. There's plenty of real things to be scared of. Like super-AIDS.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Huh s-s-super-AIDS?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","That's right. A new form of AIDS which is resistant to drugs. Just one teaspoon of super-AIDS in your butt and you're dead in three years.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","AAAH!  Oh Jesus.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","So now you feel better? Ghosts don't exist and there's nothing to be afraid of. Except the super-AIDS.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a muhouse.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters...","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters, you have to help me!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Go away! You aren't real!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","All right, Butters, you leave me no choice.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Butters, what is going on?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well it's all...  Well he was...  Nothin' I I just had a nightmare.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Well you'd better stop having nightmares or eles you're gonna be grounded!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Y yes, yes sir.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","AH-","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","But I don't want to see you!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Get a hold of yourself! I'm the one who died! And for some reason, my spirit is trapped here on Earth. I can't find the passage to Heaven.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well... how do you know you're supposed to go to Heaven?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","What do you mean?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Oh.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","I can't. Ahah I have school tomorrow.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","This is your problem, Butters! Either you help me, or I will haunt you for the rest of your life!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Mrs. Cartman?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LIANE","Yes?  Oh hi.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LIANE","Oh, what is it?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Tell her, tell her that I love her.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","He says, he love you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LIANE","Oh, that's so nice.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LIANE","Oh, that's so sweet. Oh, I love you too, poopiekins!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Just the good times.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KYLE","There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I can't! Don't you understand?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","He can't! Don't you understand?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Uhh all right then.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STAN","Who was that?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KYLE","It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STAN","Dude, he did that to me this morning.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KENNY","(Me too.)","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KYLE","He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"KENNY","(That guy would try anything)","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STAN","Yeah, we know better than to think that.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess. All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Aww, that's okay, Eric.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","So I won't see you again?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Don't be sad, Butters. What awaits each person in heaven is eternal bliss, divine rest, and ten thousand dollars cash.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Wow.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Yeh you're still here.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","What else do I have to do?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Atone?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Did you ever do anything really bad?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Not really...","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Broke fence...","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uuh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Really?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I know how.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"ERIC CARTMAN","I'm gonna make, make it right.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Well, there's everything, Butters. I've made everything right.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Does this mean... you have to go now?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Butters! What have you done?!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","Oh, Stephen, I don't know if we should ground him or call a doctor.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","No, I think you'd better call a doctor. I'll ground him.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","What do you think, Doctor?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"DOCTOR","Your son is suffering from severe dementia. He claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him. This is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the child's past. I think it's best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","Oh no.  NO!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"DOCTOR","All right, Butters, just try to relax. Doin' just fine, Butters.  Just stay perfectly still now, Butters.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Lu lu lu, lu lu lu","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"DOCTOR","Good. You're gonna feel a little pinch now, Butters.  Don't worry, Mr. Stotch. Whatever traumatized yoru son in his past, we'll find it.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"DOCTOR","Well, after fourteen hours of testing, I can say Butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressied memory syndrome. You see, Butters, when the brain wants to cover something up, it makes up images and sounds for you to hear.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"STEPHEN","Now do you believe us, Butters?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"DOCTOR","Good. We're making a lot of headway. We'll do some more testing tomorrow. All right, folks. Let's let Butters get some rest.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"LINDA","Goodnight, baby.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Ahhh.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Butters.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"CARTMAN","She's gonna close soon! Come on!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"PSYCHIC","Certainly. Come in.  Have a seat and tell me what it is you seek.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"PSYCHIC","Well, many times, the reason that the sould stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131
"BUTTERS","Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!","the-death-of-eric-cartman",131

"SARAH","Hey Jimmy, how was school?","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Fine, Mom.","erection-day",132
"RYAN","Jimmy, we understand you're getting erections in the classroom.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","What? Uh who told you that?","erection-day",132
"RYAN","Mr. Mackey, your counselor.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!","erection-day",132
"RYAN","Now, Jimmy, it's nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it's something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor's advice 'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Dz-n-Doctor Pal?","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Hey Jimmy, I'm Doctor Pal. That's because I'm a doctor, but I'm also your pal. Are we cool?","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Uh, sure?","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I'm I'm down, I'm dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections. ""Oops, can't say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird"" huh?","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Well, a little, yes.","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Jimmy, there's nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It's just part of grwoing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don't you skidaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.","erection-day",132
"RYAN","A-all right, come on, honey.","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Ke...c-come again?","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Oh, hey, nothin', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin' a different way. That's what Doctor Pal is here to do.  Unless, of course, you think we should take off our shirts and kiss.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss","erection-day",132
"DOCTOR PAL","Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own.","erection-day",132
"ANNOUNCER","Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer!","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.""  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems. Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience. What a fantastic audience.","erection-day",132
"MRS. GARRISON","Don't worry, Jimmy. We're not laughing with you, we're laughing AT you.","erection-day",132

"BUTTERS","Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.","erection-day",132
"BUTTERS","Oh Gosh, I'd never make fun of somebody with a problem.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?","erection-day",132
"BUTTERS","Well sure I do.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Really??","erection-day",132
"BUTTERS","Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina."" Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk.thepenis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?","erection-day",132
"BUTTERS","That's right, Jimmy.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.","erection-day",132
"GIRL","Talk to you, Bertha.","erection-day",132
"BERTHA","Okay, see you later, Jessie.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Hey Bertha.","erection-day",132
"BERTHA","Oh, hey Jimmy. What's goin' on?","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?","erection-day",132
"BERTHA","What?? No way!","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo!","erection-day",132
"BERTHA","Jerk!","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Well, wha-what do I do?","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her thnk you're a good listener.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Wow! Thanks, Eric.","erection-day",132
"MOM","Shawna honey, I think your little date is here.","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","Okay, Mom.","erection-day",132

"SHAWNA","Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?","erection-day",132

"JIMMY","Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers","erection-day",132
"WAITER","Right away.","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","You know that girl Sally Rauman at our school? I can't stand her.","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, ""No WAY do I want it now!"" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","All right, when she stops yappin' again, say ""Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.""","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","-I guess that's why I figured, ""Who needs friends like that?""","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","It's like I told Debbie: ""If you're gonna go out with my friends-""","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","""And so if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend.""","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","""if you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" Wow, how insightful.","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Really?","erection-day",132
"SHAWNA","Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.","erection-day",132
"JIMMY","Oh, I'm so glad you think so, Shawna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.","erection-day",132
"CARTMAN","Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.","erection-day",132
